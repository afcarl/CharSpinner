       "\"alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, and where is the use of a book, thought alice, without pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain was worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. there was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself dear, dear i shall be too late (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all quite natural); but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, looked at it, and then hurried on, alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and, full of curiosity, she hurried across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. in a moment down went alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly, that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself, before she found herself falling down what seemed a deep well. either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what would happen next. first, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then, she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there were maps and pictures hung on pegs. she took a jar down off one of the shelves as she passed: it was labelled orange marmalade, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. well thought alice to herself, after such a fall as this, i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave they'll all think me at home why, i wouldn't say anything about it, even if i fell off the top of the house (which was most likely true.) down, down, down. would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles i've fallen by this time she said aloud, i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, i think (for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity of showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to hear her, still it was good practice to say it over,) yes that's the right distance, but then what longitude or latitude-line shall i be in (alice had no idea what longitude was, or latitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.) presently she began again: i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny it'll be to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. please, ma'am, is this new zealand or australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke (fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air do you think you could manage it ) and what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking no, it'll never do to ask: perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere. down, down, down: there was nothing else to do, so alice soon began talking again. dinah will miss me very much tonight, i should think (dinah was the cat.) i hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time oh, dear dinah, i wish i had you here there are no mice in the air, i'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know, my dear. but do cats eat bats, i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy, and kept on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes, do bats eat cats for, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. she felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah, and was saying to her very earnestly, now, dinah, my dear, tell me the truth. did you ever eat a bat when suddenly, bump bump down she came upon a heap of sticks and shavings, and the fall was over. alice was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. there was not a moment to be lost: away went alice like the wind, and just heard it say, as it turned a corner, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting she turned the corner after it, and instantly found herself in a long, low hall, lit up by a row of lamps which hung from the roof. there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when alice had been all round it, and tried them all, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again: suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing lying upon it, but a tiny golden key, and alice's first idea was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall, but alas either the locks were too large, or the key too small, but at any rate it would open none of them. however, on the second time round, she came to a low curtain, behind which was a door about eighteen inches high: she tried the little key in the keyhole, and it fitted alice opened the door, and looked down a small passage, not larger than a rat-hole, into the loveliest garden you ever saw. how she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway, and even if my head would go through, thought poor alice, it would be very little use without my shoulders. oh, how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could, if i only knew how to begin. for, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that alice began to think very few things indeed were really impossible. there was nothing else to do, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting up people like telescopes: this time there was a little bottle on it which certainly was not there before said alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters. it was all very well to say drink me, but i'll look first, said the wise little alice, and see whether the bottle's marked poison or not, for alice had read several nice little stories about children that got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had given them, such as, that, if you get into the fire, it will burn you, and that, if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it generally bleeds, and she had never forgotten that, if you drink a bottle marked poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. however, this bottle was not marked poison, so alice tasted it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. what a curious feeling said alice, i must be shutting up like a telescope. it was so indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up as it occurred to her that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. first, however, she waited for a few minutes to see whether she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this, for it might end, you know, said alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle, and what should i be like then, i wonder and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember having ever seen one. however, nothing more happened so she decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor alice when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for the key, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. come there's no use in crying said alice to herself rather sharply, i advise you to leave off this minute (she generally gave herself very good advice, and sometimes scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes, and once she remembered boxing her own ears for having been unkind to herself in a game of croquet she was playing with herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people,) but it's no use now, thought poor alice, to pretend to be two people why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person soon her eyes fell on a little ebony box lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which was lying a card with the words eat me beautifully printed on it in large letters. i'll eat, said alice, and if it makes me larger, i can reach the key, and if it makes me smaller, i can creep under the door, so either way i'll get into the garden, and i don't care which happens she ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself which way which way and laid her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure this is what generally happens when one eats cake, but alice had got into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the way things to happen, and it seemed quite dull and stupid for things to go on in the common way. so she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. curiouser and curiouser cried alice, (she was so surprised that she quite forgot how to speak good english,) now i'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was goodbye, feet (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they were getting so far off,) oh, my poor little feet, i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears i'm sure i can't i shall be a great deal too far off to bother myself about you: you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them, thought alice, or perhaps they won't walk the way i want to go let me see: i'll give them a new pair of boots every christmas. and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it they must go by the carrier, she thought, and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet and how odd the directions will look alice's right foot, esq. the carpet, with alice's love oh dear what nonsense i am talking just at this moment, her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key, and hurried off to the garden door. poor alice it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye, but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and cried again. you ought to be ashamed of yourself, said alice, a great girl like you, (she might well say this,) to cry in this way stop this instant, i tell you but she cried on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool, about four inches deep, all round her, and reaching half way across the hall. after a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and dried her eyes to see what was coming. it was the white rabbit coming back again, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand, and a nosegay in the other. alice was ready to ask help of any one, she felt so desperate, and as the rabbit passed her, she said, in a low, timid voice, if you please, sir the rabbit started violently, looked up once into the roof of the hall, from which the voice seemed to come, and then dropped the nosegay and the white kid gloves, and skurried away into the darkness, as hard as it could go. alice took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so delicious that she kept smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself dear, dear how queer everything is today and yesterday everything happened just as usual: i wonder if i was changed in the night let me think: was i the same when i got up this morning i think i remember feeling rather different. but if i'm not the same, who in the world am i ah, that's the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them. i'm sure i'm not gertrude, she said, for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all and i'm sure i ca'n't be florence, for i know all sorts of things, and she, oh she knows such a very little besides, she's she, and i'm i, and oh dear how puzzling it all is i'll try if i know all the things i used to know. let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is fourteen oh dear i shall never get to twenty at this rate but the multiplication table don't signify let's try geography. london is the capital of france, and rome is the capital of yorkshire, and paris oh dear dear that's all wrong, i'm certain i must have been changed for florence i'll try and say how doth the little, and she crossed her hands on her lap, and began, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not sound the same as they used to do: how doth the little crocodile improve its shining tail, and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale how cheerfully it seems to grin how neatly spreads its claws and welcomes little fishes in with gently-smiling jaws i'm sure those are not the right words, said poor alice, and her eyes filled with tears as she thought i must be florence after all, and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh ever so many lessons to learn no i've made up my mind about it: if i'm florence, i'll stay down here it'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying 'come up, dear ' i shall only look up and say 'who am i then answer me that first, and then, if i like being that person, i'll come up: if not, i'll stay down here till i'm somebody else but, oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst of tears, i do wish they would put their heads down i am so tired of being all alone here as she said this, she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to find she had put on one of the rabbit's little gloves while she was talking. how can i have done that thought she, i must be growing small again. she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: soon she found out that the reason of it was the nosegay she held in her hand: she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether, and found that she was now only three inches high. now for the garden cried alice, as she hurried back to the little door, but the little door was locked again, and the little gold key was lying on the glass table as before, and things are worse than ever thought the poor little girl, for i never was as small as this before, never and i declare it's too bad, it is at this moment her foot slipped, and splash she was up to her chin in salt water. her first idea was that she had fallen into the sea: then she remembered that she was under ground, and she soon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high. i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out, i shall be punished for it now, i suppose, by being drowned in my own tears well that'll be a queer thing, to be sure however, every thing is queer today. very soon she saw something splashing about in the pool near her: at first she thought it must be a walrus or a hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was herself, and soon made out that it was only a mouse, that had slipped in like herself. would it be any use, now, thought alice, to speak to this mouse the rabbit is something quite out-of-the-way, no doubt, and so have i been, ever since i came down here, but that is no reason why the mouse should not be able to talk. i think i may as well try. so she began: oh mouse, do you know how to get out of this pool i am very tired of swimming about here, oh mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. perhaps it doesn't understand english, thought alice; i daresay it's a french mouse, come over with william the conqueror (for, with all her knowledge of history, alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened,) so she began again: ou est ma chatte which was the first sentence out of her french lesson-book. the mouse gave a sudden jump in the pool, and seemed to quiver with fright: oh, i beg your pardon cried alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings, i quite forgot you didn't like cats not like cats cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice, would you like cats if you were me well, perhaps not, said alice in a soothing tone, don't be angry about it. and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah: i think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. she is such a dear quiet thing, said alice, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face: and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse, and she's such a capital one for catching mice oh i beg your pardon cried poor alice again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain that it was really offended, have i offended you offended indeed cried the mouse, who seemed to be positively trembling with rage, our family always hated cats nasty, low, vulgar things don't talk to me about them any more i won't indeed said alice, in a great hurry to change the conversation, are you are you fond of dogs the mouse did not answer, so alice went on eagerly: there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh such long curly brown hair and it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things i ca'n't remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer, and he says it kills all the rats and oh dear said alice sadly, i'm afraid i've offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. so she called softly after it: mouse dear do come back again, and we won't talk about cats and dogs any more, if you don't like them when the mouse heard this, it turned and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale, (with passion, alice thought,) and it said in a trembling low voice let's get to the shore, and then i'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs. it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of birds and animals that had fallen into it. there was a duck and a dodo, a lory and an eaglet, and several other curious creatures. alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. they were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. the first question of course was, how to get dry: they had a consultation about this, and alice hardly felt at all surprised at finding herself talking familiarly with the birds, as if she had known them all her life. indeed, she had quite a long argument with the lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say i am older than you, and must know best, and this alice would not admit without knowing how old the lory was, and as the lory positively refused to tell its age, there was nothing more to be said. at last the mouse, who seemed to have some authority among them, called out sit down, all of you, and attend to me i'll soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once, shivering, in a large ring, alice in the middle, with her eyes anxiously fixed on the mouse, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. ahem said the mouse, with a self-important air, are you all ready this is the driest thing i know. silence all round, if you please william the conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the english, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. edwin and morcar, the earls of mercia and northumbria ugh said the lory with a shiver. i beg your pardon said the mouse, frowning, but very politely, did you speak not i said the lory hastily. i thought you did, said the mouse, i proceed. edwin and morcar, the earls of mercia and northumbria, declared for him; and even stigand, the patriotic archbishop of canterbury, found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown. william's conduct was at first moderate how are you getting on now, dear said the mouse, turning to alice as it spoke. as wet as ever, said poor alice, it doesn't seem to dry me at all. in that case, said the dodo solemnly, rising to his feet, i move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies speak english said the duck, i don't know the meaning of half those long words, and what's more, i don't believe you do either and the duck quacked a comfortable laugh to itself. some of the other birds tittered audibly. i only meant to say, said the dodo in a rather offended tone, that i know of a house near here, where we could get the young lady and the rest of the party dried, and then we could listen comfortably to the story which i think you were good enough to promise to tell us, bowing gravely to the mouse. the mouse made no objection to this, and the whole party moved along the river bank, (for the pool had by this time began to flow out of the hall, and the edge of it was fringed with rushes and forget-me-nots,) in a slow procession, the dodo leading the way. after a time the dodo became impatient, and, leaving the duck to bring up the rest of the party, moved on at a quicker pace with alice, the lory, and the eaglet, and soon brought them to a little cottage, and there they sat snugly by the fire, wrapped up in blankets, until the rest of the party had arrived, and they were all dry again. then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank, and begged the mouse to begin his story. mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse, turning to alice, and sighing. it is a long tail, certainly, said alice, looking down with wonder at the mouse's tail, which was coiled nearly all round the party, but why do you call it sad and she went on puzzling about this as the mouse went on speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this: you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely, what are you thinking of i beg your pardon, said alice very humbly, you had got to the fifth bend, i think i had not cried the mouse, sharply and very angrily. a knot said alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her, oh, do let me help to undo it i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse, getting up and walking away from the party, you insult me by talking such nonsense i didn't mean it pleaded poor alice, but you're so easily offended, you know. the mouse only growled in reply. please come back and finish your story alice called after it, and the others all joined in chorus yes, please do but the mouse only shook its ears, and walked quickly away, and was soon out of sight. what a pity it wouldn't stay sighed the lory, and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to its daughter ah, my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongue, ma said the young crab, a little snappishly, you're enough to try the patience of an oyster i wish i had our dinah here, i know i do said alice aloud, addressing no one in particular, she'd soon fetch it back and who is dinah, if i might venture to ask the question said the lory. alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet, dinah's our cat. and she's such a capital one for catching mice, you can't think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it this answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party: some of the birds hurried off at once; one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking i really must be getting home: the night air does not suit my throat, and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away from her, my dears, she's no fit company for you on various pretexts, they all moved off, and alice was soon left alone. she sat for some while sorrowful and silent, but she was not long before she recovered her spirits, and began talking to herself again as usual: i do wish some of them had stayed a little longer and i was getting to be such friends with them really the lory and i were almost like sisters and so was that dear little eaglet and then the duck and the dodo how nicely the duck sang to us as we came along through the water: and if the dodo hadn't known the way to that nice little cottage, i don't know when we should have got dry again and there is no knowing how long she might have prattled on in this way, if she had not suddenly caught the sound of pattering feet. it was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about it as it went, as if it had lost something, and she heard it muttering to itself the marchioness the marchioness oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers she'll have me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them, i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the nosegay and the pair of white kid gloves, and she began hunting for them, but they were now nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and her walk along the river-bank with its fringe of rushes and forget-me-nots, and the glass table and the little door had vanished. soon the rabbit noticed alice, as she stood looking curiously about her, and at once said in a quick angry tone, why, mary ann what are you doing out here go home this moment, and look on my dressing-table for my gloves and nosegay, and fetch them here, as quick as you can run, do you hear and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once, without saying a word, in the direction which the rabbit had pointed out. she soon found herself in front of a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w. rabbit, esq. she went in, and hurried upstairs, for fear she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the gloves: she knew that one pair had been lost in the hall, but of course, thought alice, it has plenty more of them in its house. how queer it seems to be going messages for a rabbit i suppose dinah'll be sending me messages next and she began fancying the sort of things that would happen: miss alice come here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute, nurse but i've got to watch this mousehole till dinah comes back, and see that the mouse doesn't get out only i don't think, alice went on, that they'd let dinah stop in the house, if it began ordering people about like that by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room, with a table in the window on which was a looking-glass and, (as alice had hoped,) two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up a pair of gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass: there was no label on it this time with the words drink me, but nonetheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips: i know something interesting is sure to happen, she said to herself, whenever i eat or drink anything, so i'll see what this bottle does. i do hope it'll make me grow larger, for i'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing it did so indeed, and much sooner than she expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and she stooped to save her neck from being broken, and hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself that's quite enough i hope i sha'n't grow any more i wish i hadn't drunk so much alas it was too late: she went on growing and growing, and very soon had to kneel down: in another minute there was not room even for this, and she tried the effect of lying down, with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. still she went on growing, and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself now i can do no more what will become of me luckily for alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger; still it was very uncomfortable, and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. it was much pleasanter at home, thought poor alice, when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits i almost wish i hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole, and yet, and yet it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life. i do wonder what can have happened to me when i used to read fairy-tales, i fancied that sort of thing never happened, and now here i am in the middle of one there out to be a book written about me, that there ought and when i grow up i'll write one but i'm grown up now said she in a sorrowful tone, at least there's no room to grow up any more here. but then, thought alice, shall i never get any older than i am now that'll be a comfort, one way never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons to learn oh, i shouldn't like that oh, you foolish alice she said again, how can you learn lessons in here why, there's hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books and so she went on, taking first one side, and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether, but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, which made her stop to listen. mary ann mary ann said the voice, fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs: alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it. presently the rabbit came to the door, and tried to open it, but as it opened inwards, and alice's elbow was against it, the attempt proved a failure. alice heard it say to itself then i'll go round and get in at the window. that you wo'n't thought alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit, just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. she did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of breaking glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. next came an angry voice the rabbit's pat, pat where are you and then a voice she had never heard before, shure then i'm here digging for apples, anyway, yer honour digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily, here, come and help me out of this sound of more breaking glass. now, tell me, pat, what is that coming out of the window shure it's an arm, yer honour (he pronounced it arrum.) an arm, you goose who ever saw an arm that size why, it fills the whole window, don't you see shure, it does, yer honour, but it's an arm for all that. well, it's no business there: go and take it away there was a long silence after this, and alice could only hear whispers now and then, such as shure i don't like it, yer honour, at all at all do as i tell you, you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. this time there were two little shrieks, and more breaking glass what a number of cucumber-frames there must be thought alice, i wonder what they'll do next as for pulling me out of the window, i only wish they could i'm sure i don't want to stop in here any longer she waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words where's the other ladder why, i hadn't to bring but one, bill's got the other here, put 'em up at this corner no, tie 'em together first they don't reach high enough yet oh, they'll do well enough, don't be particular here, bill catch hold of this rope will the roof bear mind that loose slate oh, it's coming down heads below (a loud crash) now, who did that it was bill, i fancy who's to go down the chimney nay, i sha'n't you do it that i won't then bill's got to go down here, bill the master says you've to go down the chimney oh, so bill's got to come down the chimney, has he said alice to herself, why, they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldn't be in bill's place for a good deal: the fireplace is a pretty tight one, but i think i can kick a little she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess what sort it was) scratching and scrambling in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself this is bill, she gave one sharp kick, and waited again to see what would happen next. the first thing was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbit's voice alone catch him, you by the hedge then silence, and then another confusion of voices, how was it, old fellow what happened to you tell us all about it. last came a little feeble squeaking voice, (that's bill thought alice,) which said well, i hardly know i'm all of a fluster myself something comes at me like a jack-in-the-box, and the next minute up i goes like a rocket and so you did, old fellow said the other voices. we must burn the house down said the voice of the rabbit, and alice called out as loud as she could if you do, i'll set dinah at you this caused silence again, and while alice was thinking but how can i get dinah here she found to her great delight that she was getting smaller: very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable position in which she had been lying, and in two or three minutes more she was once more three inches high. she ran out of the house as quick as she could, and found quite a crowd of little animals waiting outside guinea-pigs, white mice, squirrels, and bill a little green lizard, that was being supported in the arms of one of the guinea-pigs, while another was giving it something out of a bottle. they all made a rush at her the moment she appeared, but alice ran her hardest, and soon found herself in a thick wood. the first thing i've got to do, said alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, is to grow to my right size, and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. i think that will be the best plan. it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged: the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it, and while she was peering anxiously among the trees round her, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to reach her: poor thing said alice in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it, but she was terribly alarmed all the while at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would probably devour her in spite of all her coaxing. hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy: whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, and with a yelp of delight rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over, and, the moment she appeared at the other side, the puppy made another dart at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold: then alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again: then the puppy begin a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut. this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape. she set off at once, and ran till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance, and till she was quite tired and out of breath. and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with her hat. i should have liked teaching it tricks, if if i'd only been the right size to do it oh i'd nearly forgotten that i've got to grow up again let me see; how is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other, but the great question is what the great question certainly was, what alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat under the circumstances. there was a large mushroom near her, about the same height as herself, and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her to look and see what was on the top of it. she stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, which was sitting with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the least notice of her or of anything else. for some time they looked at each other in silence: at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and languidly addressed her. who are you said the caterpillar. this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation: alice replied rather shyly, i i hardly know, sir, just at present at least i know who i was when i got up this morning, but i think i must have been changed several times since that. what do you mean by that said the caterpillar, explain yourself i ca'n't explain myself, i'm afraid, sir, said alice, because i'm not myself, you see. i don't see, said the caterpillar. i'm afraid i can't put it more clearly, alice replied very politely, for i ca'n't understand it myself, and really to be so many different sizes in one day is very confusing. it isn't, said the caterpillar. well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet, said alice, but when you have to turn into a chrysalis, you know, and then after that into a butterfly, i should think it'll feel a little queer, don't you think so not a bit, said the caterpillar. all i know is, said alice, it would feel queer to me. you said the caterpillar contemptuously, who are you which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation: alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are, first. why said the caterpillar. here was another puzzling question: and as alice had no reason ready, and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very bad temper, she turned round and walked away. come back the caterpillar called after her, i've something important to say this sounded promising: alice turned and came back again. keep your temper, said the caterpillar. is that all said alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. no, said the caterpillar. alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all the caterpillar might tell her something worth hearing. for some minutes it puffed away at its hookah without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said so you think you're changed, do you yes, sir, said alice, i ca'n't remember the things i used to know i've tried to say how doth the little busy bee and it came all different try and repeat you are old, father william, said the caterpillar. alice folded her hands, and began: you are old, father william, the young man said, and your hair is exceedingly white: and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think, at your age, it is right in my youth, father william replied to his son, i feared it might injure the brain but now that i'm perfectly sure i have none, why, i do it again and again. you are old, said the youth, as i mentioned before, and have grown most uncommonly fat: yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that in my youth, said the sage, as he shook his gray locks, i kept all my limbs very supple, by the use of this ointment, five shillings the box allow me to sell you a couple. you are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet: yet you eat all the goose, with the bones and the beak pray, how did you manage to do it in my youth, said the old man, i took to the law, and argued each case with my wife, and the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, has lasted the rest of my life. you are old, said the youth; one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever: yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever i have answered three questions, and that is enough, said his father, don't give yourself airs do you think i can listen all day to such stuff be off, or i'll kick you down stairs that is not said right, said the caterpillar. not quite right, i'm afraid, said alice timidly, some of the words have got altered. it is wrong from beginning to end, said the caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes: the caterpillar was the first to speak. what size do you want to be it asked. oh, i'm not particular as to size, alice hastily replied, only one doesn't like changing so often, you know. are you content now said the caterpillar. well, i should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind, said alice, three inches is such a wretched height to be. it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar loudly and angrily, rearing itself straight up as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). but i'm not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone, and she thought to herself i wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended you'll get used to it in time, said the caterpillar, and it put the hookah into its mouth, and began smoking again. this time alice waited quietly until it chose to speak again: in a few minutes the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and got down off the mushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking as it went; the top will make you grow taller, and the stalk will make you grow shorter. the top of what the stalk of what thought alice. of the mushroom, said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud, and in another moment was out of sight. alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, and then picked it and carefully broke it in two, taking the stalk in one hand, and the top in the other. which does the stalk do she said, and nibbled a little bit of it to try; the next moment she felt a violent blow on her chin: it had struck her foot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but as she did not shrink any further, and had not dropped the top of the mushroom, she did not give up hope yet. there was hardly room to open her mouth, with her chin pressing against her foot, but she did it at last, and managed to bite off a little bit of the top of the mushroom. come my head's free at last said alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be seen: she looked down upon an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her. what can all that green stuff be said alice, and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i ca'n't see you she was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little rustling among the leaves. then she tried to bring her head down to her hands, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in every direction, like a serpent. she had just succeeded in bending it down in a beautiful zig-zag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had been wandering in, when a sharp hiss made her draw back: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was violently beating her with its wings. serpent screamed the pigeon. i'm not a serpent said alice indignantly, let me alone i've tried every way the pigeon said desperately, with a kind of sob: nothing seems to suit 'em i haven't the least idea what you mean, said alice. i've tried the roots of trees, and i've tried banks, and i've tried hedges, the pigeon went on without attending to her, but them serpents there's no pleasing 'em alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything till the pigeon had finished. as if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon, without being on the look out for serpents, day and night why, i haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks i'm very sorry you've been annoyed, said alice, beginning to see its meaning. and just as i'd taken the highest tree in the wood, said the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek, and was just thinking i was free of 'em at last, they must needs come down from the sky ugh serpent but i'm not a serpent, said alice, i'm a i'm a well what are you said the pigeon, i see you're trying to invent something. i i'm a little girl, said alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through. a likely story indeed said the pigeon, i've seen a good many of them in my time, but never one with such a neck as yours no, you're a serpent, i know that well enough i suppose you'll tell me next that you never tasted an egg i have tasted eggs, certainly, said alice, who was a very truthful child, but indeed i do'n't want any of yours. i do'n't like them raw. well, be off, then said the pigeon, and settled down into its nest again. alice crouched down among the trees, as well as she could, as her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and several times she had to stop and untwist it. soon she remembered the pieces of mushroom which she still held in her hands, and set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual size. it was so long since she had been of the right size that it felt quite strange at first, but she got quite used to it in a minute or two, and began talking to herself as usual: well there's half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are i'm never sure what i'm going to be, from one minute to another however, i've got to my right size again: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done, i wonder just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a doorway leading right into it. that's very curious she thought, but everything's curious today: i may as well go in. and in she went. once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table: now, i'll manage better this time she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. then she set to work eating the pieces of mushroom till she was about fifteen inches high: then she walked down the little passage: and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains. chapter iv a large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. this alice thought a very curious thing, and she went near to watch them, and just as she came up she heard one of them say look out, five don't go splashing paint over me like that i couldn't help it, said five in a sulky tone, seven jogged my elbow. on which seven lifted up his head and said that's right, five always lay the blame on others you'd better not talk said five, i heard the queen say only yesterday she thought of having you beheaded what for said the one who had spoken first. that's not your business, two said seven. yes, it is his business said five, and i'll tell him: it was for bringing in tulip-roots to the cook instead of potatoes. seven flung down his brush, and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye fell upon alice, and he stopped suddenly; the others looked round, and all of them took off their hats and bowed low. would you tell me, please, said alice timidly, why you are painting those roses five and seven looked at two, but said nothing: two began, in a low voice, why, miss, the fact is, this ought to have been a red rose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake, and if the queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off. so, you see, we're doing our best, before she comes, to at this moment five, who had been looking anxiously across the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. there was a sound of many footsteps, and alice looked round, eager to see the queen. first came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, flat and oblong, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all ornamented with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. after these came the royal children: there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along, hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. next came the guests, mostly kings and queens, among whom alice recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. then followed the knave of hearts, carrying the king's crown on a cushion, and, last of all this grand procession, came the king and queen of hearts. when the procession came opposite to alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. idiot said the queen, turning up her nose, and asked alice what's your name my name is alice, so please your majesty, said alice boldly, for she thought to herself why, they're only a pack of cards i needn't be afraid of them who are these said the queen, pointing to the three gardeners lying round the rose tree, for, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. how should i know said alice, surprised at her own courage, it's no business of mine. the queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a minute, began in a voice of thunder off with her nonsense said alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the queen was silent. the king laid his hand upon her arm, and said timidly remember, my dear she is only a child the queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the knave turn them over the knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. get up said the queen, in a shrill loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the king, the queen, the royal children, and everybody else. leave off that screamed the queen, you make me giddy. and then, turning to the rose tree, she went on what have you been doing here may it please your majesty, said two very humbly, going down on one knee as he spoke, we were trying i see said the queen, who had meantime been examining the roses, off with their heads and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the three unfortunate gardeners, who ran to alice for protection. you sha'n't be beheaded said alice, and she put them into her pocket: the three soldiers marched once round her, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. are their heads off shouted the queen. their heads are gone, the soldiers shouted in reply, if it please your majesty that's right shouted the queen, can you play croquet the soldiers were silent, and looked at alice, as the question was evidently meant for her. yes shouted alice at the top of her voice. come on then roared the queen, and alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next. it's it's a very fine day said a timid little voice: she was walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. very, said alice, where's the marchioness hush, hush said the rabbit in a low voice, she'll hear you. the queen's the marchioness: didn't you know that no, i didn't, said alice, what of queen of hearts, said the rabbit in a whisper, putting its mouth close to her ear, and marchioness of mock turtles. what are they said alice, but there was no time for the answer, for they had reached the croquet-ground, and the game began instantly. alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in all her life: it was all in ridges and furrows: the croquet-balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live ostriches, and the soldiers had to double themselves up, and stand on their feet and hands, to make the arches. the chief difficulty which alice found at first was to manage her ostrich: she got its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck straightened out nicely, and was going to give a blow with its head, it would twist itself round, and look up into her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or a furrow in her way, wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. the players all played at once without waiting for turns, and quarrelled all the while at the tops of their voices, and in a very few minutes the queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about and shouting off with his head of off with her head about once in a minute. all those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of half an hour or so, there were no arches left, and all the players, except the king, the queen, and alice, were in custody, and under sentence of execution. then the queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle no, said alice, i don't even know what a mock turtle is. come on then, said the queen, and it shall tell you its history. as they walked off together, alice heard the king say in a low voice, to the company generally, you are all pardoned. come, that's a good thing thought alice, who had felt quite grieved at the number of executions which the queen had ordered. they very soon came upon a gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the sun: (if you don't know what a gryphon is, look at the picture): up, lazy thing said the queen, and take this young lady to see the mock turtle, and to hear its history. i must go back and see after some executions i ordered, and she walked off, leaving alice with the gryphon. alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it quite as safe to stay as to go after that savage queen: so she waited. the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. what fun said the gryphon, half to itself, half to alice. what is the fun said alice. why, she, said the gryphon; it's all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know: come on everybody says 'come on ' here, thought alice as she walked slowly after the gryphon; i never was ordered about so before in all my life never they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, alice could here it sighing as if its heart would break. she pitied it deeply: what is its sorrow she asked the gryphon, and the gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, it's all its fancy, that: it hasn't got no sorrow, you know: come on so they went up to the mock turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. this here young lady said the gryphon, wants for to know your history, she do. i'll tell it, said the mock turtle, in a deep hollow tone, sit down, and don't speak till i've finished. so they sat down, and no one spoke for some minutes: alice thought to herself i don't see how it can ever finish, if it doesn't begin, but she waited patiently. once, said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, i was a real turtle. these words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle. alice was very nearly getting up and saying, thank you, sir, for your interesting story, but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing. when we were little, the mock turtle went on, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, we went to school in the sea. the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise why did you call him tortoise, if he wasn't one asked alice. we called him tortoise because he taught us, said the mock turtle angrily, really you are very dull you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question, added the gryphon, and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth: at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle, get on, old fellow don't be all day and the mock turtle went on in these words: you may not have lived much under the sea (i haven't, said alice,) and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster (alice began to say i once tasted but hastily checked herself, and said no, never, instead,) so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is no, indeed, said alice, what sort of a thing is it why, said the gryphon, you form into a line along the sea shore two lines cried the mock turtle, seals, turtles, salmon, and so on advance twice each with a lobster as partner cried the gryphon. of course, the mock turtle said, advance twice, set to partners change lobsters, and retire in same order interrupted the gryphon. then, you know, continued the mock turtle, you throw the the lobsters shouted the gryphon, with a bound into the air. as far out to sea as you can swim after them screamed the gryphon. turn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle, capering wildly about. change lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice, and then that's all, said the mock turtle, suddenly dropping its voice, and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at alice. it must be a very pretty dance, said alice timidly. would you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle. very much indeed, said alice. come, let's try the first figure said the mock turtle to the gryphon, we can do it without lobsters, you know. which shall sing oh you sing said the gryphon, i've forgotten the words. so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they came too close, and waving their fore-paws to mark the time, while the mock turtle sang, slowly and sadly, these words: beneath the waters of the sea are lobsters thick as thick can be they love to dance with you and me, my own, my gentle salmon the gryphon joined in singing the chorus, which was: salmon come up salmon go down salmon come twist your tail around of all the fishes of the sea there's none so good as salmon thank you, said alice, feeling very glad that the figure was over. shall we try the second figure said the gryphon, or would you prefer a song oh, a song, please alice replied, so eagerly, that the gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, hm no accounting for tastes sing her 'mock turtle soup', will you, old fellow the mock turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this: beautiful soup, so rich and green, waiting in a hot tureen who for such dainties would not stoop soup of the evening, beautiful soup soup of the evening, beautiful soup beau ootiful soo oop beau ootiful soo oop soo oop of the e e evening, beautiful beautiful soup chorus again cried the gryphon, and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of the trial's beginning was heard in the distance. come on cried the gryphon, and, taking alice by the hand, he hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song. what trial is it panted alice as she ran, but the gryphon only answered come on and ran the faster, and more and more faintly came, borne on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words: soo oop of the e e evening, beautiful beautiful soup the king and queen were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled around them: the knave was in custody: and before the king stood the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. herald read the accusation said the king. on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows: the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day: the knave of hearts he stole those tarts, and took them quite away now for the evidence, said the king, and then the sentence. no said the queen, first the sentence, and then the evidence nonsense cried alice, so loudly that everybody jumped, the idea of having the sentence first hold your tongue said the queen. i won't said alice, you're nothing but a pack of cards who cares for you at this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream of fright, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some leaves that had fluttered down from the trees on to her face. wake up alice dear said her sister, what a nice long sleep you've had oh, i've had such a curious dream said alice, and she told her sister all her adventures under ground, as you have read them, and when she had finished, her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream, dear, certainly but now run in to your tea: it's getting late. so alice ran off, thinking while she ran (as well she might) what a wonderful dream it had been. but her sister sat there some while longer, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little alice and her adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream: she saw an ancient city, and a quiet river winding near it along the plain, and up the stream went slowly gliding a boat with a merry party of children on board she could hear their voices and laughter like music over the water and among them was another little alice, who sat listening with bright eager eyes to a tale that was being told, and she listened for the words of the tale, and lo it was the dream of her own little sister. so the boat wound slowly along, beneath the bright summer-day, with its merry crew and its music of voices and laughter, till it passed round one of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw it no more. then she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how this same little alice would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman: and how she would keep, through her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather around her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a wonderful tale, perhaps even with these very adventures of the little alice of long-ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days. happy summer days. the end. postscript. the profits, if any, of this book will be given to children's hospitals and convalescent homes for sick children; and the accounts, down to junein each year, will be published in the st. james's gazette, on the second tuesday of the following december. p.p.s. the thought, so prettily expressed by the little boy, is also to be found in longfellow's hiawatha, where he appeals to those who believe that the feeble hands and helpless, groping blindly in the darkness , touch god's right hand in that darkness , and are lifted up and strengthened . who will riddle me the how and the why so questions one of england's sweetest singers. the how has already been told, after a fashion, in the verses prefixed to alice in wonderland; and some other memories of that happy summer day are set down, for those who care to see them, in this little book the germ that was to grow into the published volume. but the why cannot, and need not, be put into words. those for whom a child's mind is a sealed book, and who see no divinity in a child's smile, would read such words in vain: while for any one that has ever loved one true child, no words are needed. for he will have known the awe that falls on one in the presence of a spirit fresh from god's hands, on whom no shadow of sin, and but the outermost fringe of the shadow of sorrow, has yet fallen: he will have felt the bitter contrast between the haunting selfishness that spoils his best deeds and the life that is but an overflowing love for i think a child's first attitude to the world is a simple love for all living things: and he will have learned that the best work a man can do is when he works for love's sake only, with no thought of name, or gain, or earthly reward. no deed of ours, i suppose, on this side the grave, is really unselfish: yet if one can put forth all one's powers in a task where nothing of reward is hoped for but a little child's whispered thanks, and the airy touch of a little child's pure lips, one seems to come somewhere near to this. there was no idea of publication in my mind when i wrote this little book : that was wholly an afterthought, pressed on me by the perhaps too partial friends who always have to bear the blame when a writer rushes into print: and i can truly say that no praise of theirs has ever given me one hundredth part of the pleasure it has been to think of the sick children in hospitals (where it has been a delight to me to send copies) forgetting, for a few bright hours, their pain and weariness perhaps thinking lovingly of the unknown writer of the tale perhaps even putting up a childish prayer (and oh, how much it needs ) for one who can but dimly hope to stand, some day, not quite out of sight of those pure young faces, before the great white throne. i am very sure, writes a lady-visitor at a home for sick children, that there will be many loving earnest prayers for you on easter morning from the children. i would like to quote further from her letters, as embodying a suggestion that may perhaps thus come to the notice of some one able and willing to carry it out. i want you to send me one of your easter greetings for a very dear child who is dying at our home. she is just fading away, and 'alice' has brightened some of the weary hours in her illness, and i know that letter would be such a delight to her especially if you would put 'minnie' at the top, and she could know you had sent it for her. she knows you, and would so value it.... she suffers so much that i long for what i know would so please her. ... thank you very much for sending me the letter, and for writing minnie's name.... i am quite sure that all these children will say a loving prayer for the 'alice-man' on easter day: and i am sure the letter will help the little ones to the real easter joy. how i do wish that you, who have won the hearts and confidence of so many children, would do for them what is so very near my heart, and yet what no one will do, viz. write a book for children about god and themselves, which is not goody, and which begins at the right end, about religion, to make them see what it really is. i get quite miserable very often over the children i come across: hardly any of them have an idea of really knowing that god loves them, or of loving and confiding in him. they will love and trust me, and be sure that i want them to be happy, and will not let them suffer more than is necessary: but as for going to him in the same way, they would never think of it. they are dreadfully afraid of him, if they think of him at all, which they generally only do when they have been naughty, and they look on all connected with him as very grave and dull: and, when they are full of fun and thoroughly happy, i am sure they unconsciously hope he is not looking. i am sure i don't wonder they think of him in this way, for people never talk of him in connection with what makes their little lives the brightest. if they are naughty, people put on solemn faces, and say he is very angry or shocked, or something which frightens them: and, for the rest, he is talked about only in a way that makes them think of church and having to be quiet. as for being taught that all joy and all gladness and brightness is his joy that he is wearying for them to be happy, and is not hard and stern, but always doing things to make their days brighter, and caring for them so tenderly, and wanting them to run to him with all their little joys and sorrows, they are not taught that. i do so long to make them trust him as they trust us, to feel that he will 'take their part' as they do with us in their little woes, and to go to him in their plays and enjoyments and not only when they say their prayers. i was quite grateful to one little dot, a short time ago, who said to his mother 'when i am in bed, i put out my hand to see if i can feel jesus and my angel. i thought perhaps in the dark they'd touch me, but they never have yet.' i do so want them to want to go to him, and to feel how, if he is there, it must be happy. let me add for i feel i have drifted into far too serious a vein for a preface to a fairy-tale the deliciously naive remark of a very dear child-friend, whom i asked, after an acquaintance of two or three days, if she had read 'alice' and the 'looking-glass.' oh yes, she replied readily, i've read both of them and i think (this more slowly and thoughtfully) i think 'through the looking-glass' is more stupid than 'alice's adventures.' don't you think so but this was a question i felt it would be hardly discreet for me to enter upon. please to fancy, if you can, that you are reading a real letter, from a real friend whom you have seen, and whose voice you can seem to yourself to hear wishing you, as i do now with all my heart, a happy easter. do you know that delicious dreamy feeling when one first wakes on a summer morning, with the twitter of birds in the air, and the fresh breeze coming in at the open window when, lying lazily with eyes half shut, one sees as in a dream green boughs waving, or waters rippling in a golden light it is a pleasure very near to sadness, bringing tears to one's eyes like a beautiful picture or poem. and is not that a mother's gentle hand that undraws your curtains, and a mother's sweet voice that summons you to rise to rise and forget, in the bright sunlight, the ugly dreams that frightened you so when all was dark to rise and enjoy another happy day, first kneeling to thank that unseen friend, who sends you the beautiful sun are these strange words from a writer of such tales as alice and is this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense it may be so. some perhaps may blame me for thus mixing together things grave and gay; others may smile and think it odd that any one should speak of solemn things at all, except in church and on a sunday: but i think nay, i am sure that some children will read this gently and lovingly, and in the spirit in which i have written it. for i do not believe god means us thus to divide life into two halves to wear a grave face on sunday, and to think it out-of-place to even so much as mention him on a week-day. do you think he cares to see only kneeling figures, and to hear only tones of prayer and that he does not also love to see the lambs leaping in the sunlight, and to hear the merry voices of the children, as they roll among the hay surely their innocent laughter is as sweet in his ears as the grandest anthem that ever rolled up from the dim religious light of some solemn cathedral and if i have written anything to add to those stores of innocent and healthy amusement that are laid up in books for the children i love so well, it is surely something i may hope to look back upon without shame and sorrow (as how much of life must then be recalled ) when my turn comes to walk through the valley of shadows. this easter sun will rise on you, dear child, feeling your life in every limb, and eager to rush out into the fresh morning air and many an easter-day will come and go, before it finds you feeble and gray-headed, creeping wearily out to bask once more in the sunlight but it is good, even now, to think sometimes of that great morning when the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings. urely your gladness need not be the less for the thought that you will one day see a brighter dawn than this when lovelier sights will meet your eyes than any waving trees or rippling waters when angel-hands shall undraw your curtains, and sweeter tones than ever loving mother breathed shall wake you to a new and glorious day and when all the sadness, and the sin, that darkened life on this little earth, shall be forgotten like the dreams of a night that is past lady dear, if fairies may for a moment lay aside cunning tricks and elfish play, 'tis at happy christmas-tide. we have heard the children say gentle children, whom we love long ago, on christmas day, came a message from above. still, as christmas-tide comes round, they remember it again echo still the joyful sound peace on earth, good-will to men yet the hearts must childlike be where such heavenly guests abide: unto children, in their glee, all the year is christmas-tide thus, forgetting tricks and play for a moment, lady dear, we would wish you, if we may, merry christmas, glad new year one thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it: it was the black kitten's fault entirely. for the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn't have had any hand in the mischief. the way dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as i said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good. but the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, while alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle. 'oh, you wicked little thing ' cried alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. 'really, dinah ought to have taught you better manners you ought, dinah, you know you ought ' she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. but she didn't get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might. 'do you know what to-morrow is, kitty ' alice began. 'you'd have guessed if you'd been up in the window with me only dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn't. i was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire and it wants plenty of sticks, kitty only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. never mind, kitty, we'll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.' here alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten's neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again. 'do you know, i was so angry, kitty,' alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again, 'when i saw all the mischief you had been doing, i was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow and you'd have deserved it, you little mischievous darling what have you got to say for yourself now don't interrupt me ' she went on, holding up one finger. 'i'm going to tell you all your faults. number one: you squeaked twice while dinah was washing your face this morning. now you can't deny it, kitty: i heard you what's that you say ' (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) 'her paw went into your eye well, that's your fault, for keeping your eyes open if you'd shut them tight up, it wouldn't have happened. now don't make any more excuses, but listen number two: you pulled snowdrop away by the tail just as i had put down the saucer of milk before her what, you were thirsty, were you how do you know she wasn't thirsty too now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while i wasn't looking 'that's three faults, kitty, and you've not been punished for any of them yet. you know i'm saving up all your punishments for wednesday week suppose they had saved up all my punishments ' she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten. 'what would they do at the end of a year i should be sent to prison, i suppose, when the day came. or let me see suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, i should have to go without fifty dinners at once well, i shouldn't mind that much i'd far rather go without them than eat them 'do you hear the snow against the window-panes, kitty how nice and soft it sounds just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. i wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently and then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, 'go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.' and when they wake up in the summer, kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about whenever the wind blows oh, that's very pretty ' cried alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. 'and i do so wish it was true i'm sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown. 'kitty, can you play chess now, don't smile, my dear, i'm asking it seriously. because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when i said 'check ' you purred well, it was a nice check, kitty, and really i might have won, if it hadn't been for that nasty knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. kitty, dear, let's pretend ' and here i wish i could tell you half the things alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase 'let's pretend.' she had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before all because alice had begun with 'let's pretend we're kings and queens;' and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn't, because there were only two of them, and alice had been reduced at last to say, 'well, you can be one of them then, and i'll be all the rest.' and once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, 'nurse do let's pretend that i'm a hungry hyaena, and you're a bone.' but this is taking us away from alice's speech to the kitten. 'let's pretend that you're the red queen, kitty do you know, i think if you sat up and folded your arms, you'd look exactly like her. now do try, there's a dear ' and alice got the red queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didn't succeed, principally, alice said, because the kitten wouldn't fold its arms properly. so, to punish it, she held it up to the looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was 'and if you're not good directly,' she added, 'i'll put you through into looking-glass house. how would you like that ' 'now, if you'll only attend, kitty, and not talk so much, i'll tell you all my ideas about looking-glass house. first, there's the room you can see through the glass that's just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way. i can see all of it when i get upon a chair all but the bit behind the fireplace. oh i do so wish i could see that bit i want so much to know whether they've a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; i know that, because i've held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room. 'how would you like to live in looking-glass house, kitty i wonder if they'd give you milk in there perhaps looking-glass milk isn't good to drink but oh, kitty now we come to the passage. you can just see a little peep of the passage in looking-glass house, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and it's very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. oh, kitty how nice it would be if we could only get through into looking-glass house i'm sure it's got, oh such beautiful things in it let's pretend there's a way of getting through into it, somehow, kitty. let's pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. why, it's turning into a sort of mist now, i declare it'll be easy enough to get through ' she was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. and certainly the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist. in another moment alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the looking-glass room. the very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. 'so i shall be as warm here as i was in the old room,' thought alice: 'warmer, in fact, because there'll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. oh, what fun it'll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can't get at me ' then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible. for instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her. 'they don't keep this room so tidy as the other,' alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little 'oh ' of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. the chessmen were walking about, two and two 'here are the red king and the red queen,' alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), 'and there are the white king and the white queen sitting on the edge of the shovel and here are two castles walking arm in arm i don't think they can hear me,' she went on, as she put her head closer down, 'and i'm nearly sure they can't see me. i feel somehow as if i were invisible ' here something began squeaking on the table behind alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the white pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next. 'it is the voice of my child ' the white queen cried out as she rushed past the king, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. 'my precious lily my imperial kitten ' and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender. 'imperial fiddlestick ' said the king, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. he had a right to be a little annoyed with the queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot. alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter. the queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little lily in silence. as soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the white king, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, 'mind the volcano ' 'what volcano ' said the king, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one. 'blew me up,' panted the queen, who was still a little out of breath. 'mind you come up the regular way don't get blown up ' alice watched the white king as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said, 'why, you'll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. i'd far better help you, hadn't i ' but the king took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her. so alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the queen, that she mightn't take his breath away: but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes. she said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the king made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor. 'oh please don't make such faces, my dear ' she cried out, quite forgetting that the king couldn't hear her. 'you make me laugh so that i can hardly hold you and don't keep your mouth so wide open all the ashes will get into it there, now i think you're tidy enough ' she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the queen. the king immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. however, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the queen were talking together in a frightened whisper so low, that alice could hardly hear what they said. the king was saying, 'i assure, you my dear, i turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers ' to which the queen replied, 'you haven't got any whiskers.' 'the horror of that moment,' the king went on, 'i shall never, never forget ' 'you will, though,' the queen said, 'if you don't make a memorandum of it.' alice looked on with great interest as the king took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. a sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him. the poor king looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, 'my dear i really must get a thinner pencil. i can't manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that i don't intend ' 'what manner of things ' said the queen, looking over the book (in which alice had put 'the white knight is sliding down the poker. he balances very badly') 'that's not a memorandum of your feelings ' there was a book lying near alice on the table, and while she sat watching the white king (for she was still a little anxious about him, and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again), she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read, ' for it's all in some language i don't know,' she said to herself. it was like this. she puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck her. 'why, it's a looking-glass book, of course and if i hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right way again.' this was the poem that alice read. jabberwocky 'twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe; all mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgrabe. 'beware the jabberwock, my son the jaws that bite, the claws that catch beware the jubjub bird, and shun the frumious bandersnatch ' he took his vorpal sword in hand: long time the manxome foe he sought so rested he by the tumtum tree, and stood awhile in thought. and as in uffish thought he stood, the jabberwock, with eyes of flame, came whiffling through the tulgey wood, and burbled as it came one, two one, two and through and through the vorpal blade went snicker-snack he left it dead, and with its head he went galumphing back. 'and hast thou slain the jabberwock come to my arms, my beamish boy o frabjous day callooh callay ' he chortled in his joy. 'twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe; all mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgrabe. 'it seems very pretty,' she said when she had finished it, 'but it's rather hard to understand ' (you see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) 'somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas only i don't exactly know what they are however, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate ' 'but oh ' thought alice, suddenly jumping up, 'if i don't make haste i shall have to go back through the looking-glass, before i've seen what the rest of the house is like let's have a look at the garden first ' she was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairs or, at least, it wasn't exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down stairs quickly and easily, as alice said to herself. she just kept the tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if she hadn't caught hold of the door-post. she was getting a little giddy with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself walking again in the natural way. chapter ii. the garden of live flowers 'i should see the garden far better,' said alice to herself, 'if i could get to the top of that hill: and here's a path that leads straight to it at least, no, it doesn't do that ' (after going a few yards along the path, and turning several sharp corners), 'but i suppose it will at last. but how curiously it twists it's more like a corkscrew than a path well, this turn goes to the hill, i suppose no, it doesn't this goes straight back to the house well then, i'll try it the other way.' and so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but always coming back to the house, do what she would. indeed, once, when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it before she could stop herself. 'it's no use talking about it,' alice said, looking up at the house and pretending it was arguing with her. 'i'm not going in again yet. i know i should have to get through the looking-glass again back into the old room and there'd be an end of all my adventures ' so, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill. for a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, 'i really shall do it this time ' when the path gave a sudden twist and shook itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found herself actually walking in at the door. 'oh, it's too bad ' she cried. 'i never saw such a house for getting in the way never ' however, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be done but start again. this time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle. 'o tiger-lily,' said alice, addressing herself to one that was waving gracefully about in the wind, 'i wish you could talk ' 'we can talk,' said the tiger-lily: 'when there's anybody worth talking to.' alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite seemed to take her breath away. at length, as the tiger-lily only went on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice almost in a whisper. 'and can all the flowers talk ' 'as well as you can,' said the tiger-lily. 'and a great deal louder.' 'it isn't manners for us to begin, you know,' said the rose, 'and i really was wondering when you'd speak said i to myself, 'her face has got some sense in it, though it's not a clever one ' still, you're the right colour, and that goes a long way.' 'i don't care about the colour,' the tiger-lily remarked. 'if only her petals curled up a little more, she'd be all right.' alice didn't like being criticised, so she began asking questions. 'aren't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody to take care of you ' 'there's the tree in the middle,' said the rose: 'what else is it good for ' 'but what could it do, if any danger came ' alice asked. 'it says 'bough-wough '' cried a daisy: 'that's why its branches are called boughs ' 'didn't you know that ' cried another daisy, and here they all began shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices. 'silence, every one of you ' cried the tiger-lily, waving itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. 'they know i can't get at them ' it panted, bending its quivering head towards alice, 'or they wouldn't dare to do it ' 'never mind ' alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, 'if you don't hold your tongues, i'll pick you ' there was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned white. 'that's right ' said the tiger-lily. 'the daisies are worst of all. when one speaks, they all begin together, and it's enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on ' 'how is it you can all talk so nicely ' alice said, hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment. 'i've been in many gardens before, but none of the flowers could talk.' 'put your hand down, and feel the ground,' said the tiger-lily. 'then you'll know why.' alice did so. 'it's very hard,' she said, 'but i don't see what that has to do with it.' 'in most gardens,' the tiger-lily said, 'they make the beds too soft so that the flowers are always asleep.' this sounded a very good reason, and alice was quite pleased to know it. 'i never thought of that before ' she said. 'it's my opinion that you never think at all,' the rose said in a rather severe tone. 'i never saw anybody that looked stupider,' a violet said, so suddenly, that alice quite jumped; for it hadn't spoken before. 'hold your tongue ' cried the tiger-lily. 'as if you ever saw anybody you keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know no more what's going on in the world, than if you were a bud ' 'are there any more people in the garden besides me ' alice said, not choosing to notice the rose's last remark. 'there's one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,' said the rose. 'i wonder how you do it ' ('you're always wondering,' said the tiger-lily), 'but she's more bushy than you are.' 'is she like me ' alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind, 'there's another little girl in the garden, somewhere ' 'well, she has the same awkward shape as you,' the rose said, 'but she's redder and her petals are shorter, i think.' 'her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,' the tiger-lily interrupted: 'not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.' 'but that's not your fault,' the rose added kindly: 'you're beginning to fade, you know and then one can't help one's petals getting a little untidy.' alice didn't like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked 'does she ever come out here ' 'i daresay you'll see her soon,' said the rose. 'she's one of the thorny kind.' 'where does she wear the thorns ' alice asked with some curiosity. 'why all round her head, of course,' the rose replied. 'i was wondering you hadn't got some too. i thought it was the regular rule.' 'she's coming ' cried the larkspur. 'i hear her footstep, thump, thump, thump, along the gravel-walk ' alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the red queen. 'she's grown a good deal ' was her first remark. she had indeed: when alice first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high and here she was, half a head taller than alice herself 'it's the fresh air that does it,' said the rose: 'wonderfully fine air it is, out here.' 'i think i'll go and meet her,' said alice, for, though the flowers were interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk with a real queen. 'you can't possibly do that,' said the rose: ' i should advise you to walk the other way.' this sounded nonsense to alice, so she said nothing, but set off at once towards the red queen. to her surprise, she lost sight of her in a moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again. a little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction. it succeeded beautifully. she had not been walking a minute before she found herself face to face with the red queen, and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aiming at. 'where do you come from ' said the red queen. 'and where are you going look up, speak nicely, and don't twiddle your fingers all the time.' alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she could, that she had lost her way. 'i don't know what you mean by your way,' said the queen: 'all the ways about here belong to me but why did you come out here at all ' she added in a kinder tone. 'curtsey while you're thinking what to say, it saves time.' alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the queen to disbelieve it. 'i'll try it when i go home,' she thought to herself, 'the next time i'm a little late for dinner.' 'it's time for you to answer now,' the queen said, looking at her watch: 'open your mouth a little wider when you speak, and always say 'your majesty.'' 'i only wanted to see what the garden was like, your majesty ' 'that's right,' said the queen, patting her on the head, which alice didn't like at all, 'though, when you say 'garden,' i've seen gardens, compared with which this would be a wilderness.' alice didn't dare to argue the point, but went on: ' and i thought i'd try and find my way to the top of that hill ' 'when you say 'hill,'' the queen interrupted, ' i could show you hills, in comparison with which you'd call that a valley.' 'no, i shouldn't,' said alice, surprised into contradicting her at last: 'a hill can't be a valley, you know. that would be nonsense ' the red queen shook her head, 'you may call it 'nonsense' if you like,' she said, 'but i've heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary ' alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the queen's tone that she was a little offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to the top of the little hill. for some minutes alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions over the country and a most curious country it was. there were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook. 'i declare it's marked out just like a large chessboard ' alice said at last. 'there ought to be some men moving about somewhere and so there are ' she added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on. 'it's a great huge game of chess that's being played all over the world if this is the world at all, you know. oh, what fun it is how i wish i was one of them i wouldn't mind being a pawn, if only i might join though of course i should like to be a queen, best.' she glanced rather shyly at the real queen as she said this, but her companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, 'that's easily managed. you can be the white queen's pawn, if you like, as lily's too young to play; and you're in the second square to begin with: when you get to the eighth square you'll be a queen ' just at this moment, somehow or other, they began to run. alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and the queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her: and still the queen kept crying 'faster faster ' but alice felt she could not go faster, though she had not breath left to say so. the most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything. 'i wonder if all the things move along with us ' thought poor puzzled alice. and the queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, 'faster don't try to talk ' not that alice had any idea of doing that. she felt as if she would never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and still the queen cried 'faster faster ' and dragged her along. 'are we nearly there ' alice managed to pant out at last. 'nearly there ' the queen repeated. 'why, we passed it ten minutes ago faster ' and they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling in alice's ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied. 'now now ' cried the queen. 'faster faster ' and they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as alice was getting quite exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground, breathless and giddy. the queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, 'you may rest a little now.' alice looked round her in great surprise. 'why, i do believe we've been under this tree the whole time everything's just as it was ' 'of course it is,' said the queen, 'what would you have it ' 'well, in our country,' said alice, still panting a little, 'you'd generally get to somewhere else if you ran very fast for a long time, as we've been doing.' 'a slow sort of country ' said the queen. 'now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. if you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that ' 'i'd rather not try, please ' said alice. 'i'm quite content to stay here only i am so hot and thirsty ' 'i know what you'd like ' the queen said good-naturedly, taking a little box out of her pocket. 'have a biscuit ' alice thought it would not be civil to say 'no,' though it wasn't at all what she wanted. so she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it was very dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all her life. 'while you're refreshing yourself,' said the queen, 'i'll just take the measurements.' and she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here and there. 'at the end of two yards,' she said, putting in a peg to mark the distance, 'i shall give you your directions have another biscuit ' 'no, thank you,' said alice: 'one's quite enough ' 'thirst quenched, i hope ' said the queen. alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the queen did not wait for an answer, but went on. 'at the end of three yards i shall repeat them for fear of your forgetting them. at the end of four, i shall say good-bye. and at the end of five, i shall go ' she had got all the pegs put in by this time, and alice looked on with great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly walking down the row. at the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, 'a pawn goes two squares in its first move, you know. so you'll go very quickly through the third square by railway, i should think and you'll find yourself in the fourth square in no time. well, that square belongs to tweedledum and tweedledee the fifth is mostly water the sixth belongs to humpty dumpty but you make no remark ' 'i i didn't know i had to make one just then,' alice faltered out. 'you should have said, 'it's extremely kind of you to tell me all this' however, we'll suppose it said the seventh square is all forest however, one of the knights will show you the way and in the eighth square we shall be queens together, and it's all feasting and fun ' alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again. at the next peg the queen turned again, and this time she said, 'speak in french when you can't think of the english for a thing turn out your toes as you walk and remember who you are ' she did not wait for alice to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she turned for a moment to say 'good-bye,' and then hurried on to the last. how it happened, alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last peg, she was gone. whether she vanished into the air, or whether she ran quickly into the wood ('and she can run very fast ' thought alice), there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and alice began to remember that she was a pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to move. of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the country she was going to travel through. 'it's something very like learning geography,' thought alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able to see a little further. 'principal rivers there are none. principal mountains i'm on the only one, but i don't think it's got any name. principal towns why, what are those creatures, making honey down there they can't be bees nobody ever saw bees a mile off, you know ' and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that was bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them, 'just as if it was a regular bee,' thought alice. however, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an elephant as alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath away at first. 'and what enormous flowers they must be ' was her next idea. 'something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put to them and what quantities of honey they must make i think i'll go down and no, i won't just yet,' she went on, checking herself just as she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly. 'it'll never do to go down among them without a good long branch to brush them away and what fun it'll be when they ask me how i like my walk. i shall say 'oh, i like it well enough '' (here came the favourite little toss of the head), ''only it was so dusty and hot, and the elephants did tease so '' 'i think i'll go down the other way,' she said after a pause: 'and perhaps i may visit the elephants later on. besides, i do so want to get into the third square ' so with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of the six little brooks. 'tickets, please ' said the guard, putting his head in at the window. in a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the same size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage. 'now then show your ticket, child ' the guard went on, looking angrily at alice. and a great many voices all said together ('like the chorus of a song,' thought alice), 'don't keep him waiting, child why, his time is worth a thousand pounds a minute ' 'i'm afraid i haven't got one,' alice said in a frightened tone: 'there wasn't a ticket-office where i came from.' and again the chorus of voices went on. 'there wasn't room for one where she came from. the land there is worth a thousand pounds an inch ' 'don't make excuses,' said the guard: 'you should have bought one from the engine-driver.' and once more the chorus of voices went on with 'the man that drives the engine. why, the smoke alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff ' alice thought to herself, 'then there's no use in speaking.' the voices didn't join in this time, as she hadn't spoken, but to her great surprise, they all thought in chorus (i hope you understand what thinking in chorus means for i must confess that i don't), 'better say nothing at all. language is worth a thousand pounds a word ' 'i shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, i know i shall ' thought alice. all this time the guard was looking at her, first through a telescope, then through a microscope, and then through an opera-glass. at last he said, 'you're travelling the wrong way,' and shut up the window and went away. 'so young a child,' said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was dressed in white paper), 'ought to know which way she's going, even if she doesn't know her own name ' a goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his eyes and said in a loud voice, 'she ought to know her way to the ticket-office, even if she doesn't know her alphabet ' there was a beetle sitting next to the goat (it was a very queer carriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be that they should all speak in turn, he went on with 'she'll have to go back from here as luggage ' alice couldn't see who was sitting beyond the beetle, but a hoarse voice spoke next. 'change engines ' it said, and was obliged to leave off. 'it sounds like a horse,' alice thought to herself. and an extremely small voice, close to her ear, said, 'you might make a joke on that something about 'horse' and 'hoarse,' you know.' then a very gentle voice in the distance said, 'she must be labelled 'lass, with care,' you know ' and after that other voices went on ('what a number of people there are in the carriage ' thought alice), saying, 'she must go by post, as she's got a head on her ' 'she must be sent as a message by the telegraph ' 'she must draw the train herself the rest of the way ' and so on. but the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered in her ear, 'never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a return-ticket every time the train stops.' 'indeed i shan't ' alice said rather impatiently. 'i don't belong to this railway journey at all i was in a wood just now and i wish i could get back there.' 'you might make a joke on that,' said the little voice close to her ear: 'something about 'you would if you could,' you know.' 'don't tease so,' said alice, looking about in vain to see where the voice came from; 'if you're so anxious to have a joke made, why don't you make one yourself ' the little voice sighed deeply: it was very unhappy, evidently, and alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, 'if it would only sigh like other people ' she thought. but this was such a wonderfully small sigh, that she wouldn't have heard it at all, if it hadn't come quite close to her ear. the consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature. 'i know you are a friend,' the little voice went on; 'a dear friend, and an old friend. and you won't hurt me, though i am an insect.' 'what kind of insect ' alice inquired a little anxiously. what she really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she thought this wouldn't be quite a civil question to ask. 'what, then you don't ' the little voice began, when it was drowned by a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm, alice among the rest. the horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in and said, 'it's only a brook we have to jump over.' everybody seemed satisfied with this, though alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all. 'however, it'll take us into the fourth square, that's some comfort ' she said to herself. in another moment she felt the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she caught at the thing nearest to her hand, which happened to be the goat's beard. but the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she found herself sitting quietly under a tree while the gnat (for that was the insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over her head, and fanning her with its wings. it certainly was a very large gnat: 'about the size of a chicken,' alice thought. still, she couldn't feel nervous with it, after they had been talking together so long. ' then you don't like all insects ' the gnat went on, as quietly as if nothing had happened. 'i like them when they can talk,' alice said. 'none of them ever talk, where i come from.' 'what sort of insects do you rejoice in, where you come from ' the gnat inquired. 'i don't rejoice in insects at all,' alice explained, 'because i'm rather afraid of them at least the large kinds. but i can tell you the names of some of them.' 'of course they answer to their names ' the gnat remarked carelessly. 'i never knew them to do it.' 'what's the use of their having names,' the gnat said, 'if they won't answer to them ' 'no use to them,' said alice; 'but it's useful to the people who name them, i suppose. if not, why do things have names at all ' 'i can't say,' the gnat replied. 'further on, in the wood down there, they've got no names however, go on with your list of insects: you're wasting time.' 'well, there's the horse-fly,' alice began, counting off the names on her fingers. 'all right,' said the gnat: 'half way up that bush, you'll see a rocking-horse-fly, if you look. it's made entirely of wood, and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch.' 'what does it live on ' alice asked, with great curiosity. 'sap and sawdust,' said the gnat. 'go on with the list.' alice looked up at the rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright and sticky; and then she went on. 'and there's the dragon-fly.' 'look on the branch above your head,' said the gnat, 'and there you'll find a snap-dragon-fly. its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.' 'and what does it live on ' 'frumenty and mince pie,' the gnat replied; 'and it makes its nest in a christmas box.' 'and then there's the butterfly,' alice went on, after she had taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to herself, 'i wonder if that's the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles because they want to turn into snap-dragon-flies ' 'crawling at your feet,' said the gnat (alice drew her feet back in some alarm), 'you may observe a bread-and-butterfly. its wings are thin slices of bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump of sugar.' 'and what does it live on ' 'weak tea with cream in it.' a new difficulty came into alice's head. 'supposing it couldn't find any ' she suggested. 'then it would die, of course.' 'but that must happen very often,' alice remarked thoughtfully. 'it always happens,' said the gnat. after this, alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. the gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last it settled again and remarked, 'i suppose you don't want to lose your name ' 'no, indeed,' alice said, a little anxiously. 'and yet i don't know,' the gnat went on in a careless tone: 'only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it for instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, she would call out 'come here ,' and there she would have to leave off, because there wouldn't be any name for her to call, and of course you wouldn't have to go, you know.' 'that would never do, i'm sure,' said alice: 'the governess would never think of excusing me lessons for that. if she couldn't remember my name, she'd call me 'miss ' as the servants do.' 'well, if she said 'miss,' and didn't say anything more,' the gnat remarked, 'of course you'd miss your lessons. that's a joke. i wish you had made it.' 'why do you wish i had made it ' alice asked. 'it's a very bad one.' but the gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down its cheeks. 'you shouldn't make jokes,' alice said, 'if it makes you so unhappy.' then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the poor gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when alice looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and walked on. she very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and alice felt a little timid about going into it. however, on second thoughts, she made up her mind to go on: 'for i certainly won't go back,' she thought to herself, and this was the only way to the eighth square. 'this must be the wood,' she said thoughtfully to herself, 'where things have no names. i wonder what'll become of my name when i go in i shouldn't like to lose it at all because they'd have to give me another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. but then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name that's just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose dogs 'answers to the name of 'dash:' had on a brass collar' just fancy calling everything you met 'alice,' till one of them answered only they wouldn't answer at all, if they were wise.' she was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked very cool and shady. 'well, at any rate it's a great comfort,' she said as she stepped under the trees, 'after being so hot, to get into the into what ' she went on, rather surprised at not being able to think of the word. 'i mean to get under the under the under this, you know ' putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. 'what does it call itself, i wonder i do believe it's got no name why, to be sure it hasn't ' she stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again. 'then it really has happened, after all and now, who am i i will remember, if i can i'm determined to do it ' but being determined didn't help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of puzzling, was, 'l, i know it begins with l ' just then a fawn came wandering by: it looked at alice with its large gentle eyes, but didn't seem at all frightened. 'here then here then ' alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it only started back a little, and then stood looking at her again. 'what do you call yourself ' the fawn said at last. such a soft sweet voice it had 'i wish i knew ' thought poor alice. she answered, rather sadly, 'nothing, just now.' 'think again,' it said: 'that won't do.' alice thought, but nothing came of it. 'please, would you tell me what you call yourself ' she said timidly. 'i think that might help a little.' 'i'll tell you, if you'll move a little further on,' the fawn said. 'i can't remember here.' so they walked on together though the wood, alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the fawn, till they came out into another open field, and here the fawn gave a sudden bound into the air, and shook itself free from alice's arms. 'i'm a fawn ' it cried out in a voice of delight, 'and, dear me you're a human child ' a sudden look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had darted away at full speed. alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. 'however, i know my name now.' she said, 'that's some comfort. alice alice i won't forget it again. and now, which of these finger-posts ought i to follow, i wonder ' it was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it. 'i'll settle it,' alice said to herself, 'when the road divides and they point different ways.' but this did not seem likely to happen. she went on and on, a long way, but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts pointing the same way, one marked 'to tweedledum's house' and the other 'to the house of tweedledee.' 'i do believe,' said alice at last, 'that they live in the same house i wonder i never thought of that before but i can't stay there long. i'll just call and say 'how d'you do ' and ask them the way out of the wood. if i could only get to the eighth square before it gets dark ' so she wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not help starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling sure that they must be. they were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other's neck, and alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them had 'dum' embroidered on his collar, and the other 'dee.' 'i suppose they've each got 'tweedle' round at the back of the collar,' she said to herself. they stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was just looking round to see if the word 'tweedle' was written at the back of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one marked 'dum.' 'if you think we're wax-works,' he said, 'you ought to pay, you know. wax-works weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow ' 'contrariwise,' added the one marked 'dee,' 'if you think we're alive, you ought to speak.' 'i'm sure i'm very sorry,' was all alice could say; for the words of the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock, and she could hardly help saying them out loud: 'tweedledum and tweedledee agreed to have a battle; for tweedledum said tweedledee had spoiled his nice new rattle. just then flew down a monstrous crow, as black as a tar-barrel; which frightened both the heroes so, they quite forgot their quarrel.' 'i know what you're thinking about,' said tweedledum: 'but it isn't so, nohow.' 'contrariwise,' continued tweedledee, 'if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't. that's logic.' 'i was thinking,' alice said very politely, 'which is the best way out of this wood: it's getting so dark. would you tell me, please ' but the little men only looked at each other and grinned. they looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that alice couldn't help pointing her finger at tweedledum, and saying 'first boy ' 'nohow ' tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again with a snap. 'next boy ' said alice, passing on to tweedledee, though she felt quite certain he would only shout out 'contrariwise ' and so he did. 'you've been wrong ' cried tweedledum. 'the first thing in a visit is to say 'how d'ye do ' and shake hands ' and here the two brothers gave each other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free, to shake hands with her. alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear of hurting the other one's feelings; so, as the best way out of the difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they were dancing round in a ring. this seemed quite natural (she remembered afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks. 'but it certainly was funny,' (alice said afterwards, when she was telling her sister the history of all this,) 'to find myself singing 'here we go round the mulberry bush.' i don't know when i began it, but somehow i felt as if i'd been singing it a long long time ' the other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. 'four times round is enough for one dance,' tweedledum panted out, and they left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same moment. then they let go of alice's hands, and stood looking at her for a minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as alice didn't know how to begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. 'it would never do to say 'how d'ye do ' now,' she said to herself: 'we seem to have got beyond that, somehow ' 'i hope you're not much tired ' she said at last. 'nohow. and thank you very much for asking,' said tweedledum. 'so much obliged ' added tweedledee. 'you like poetry ' 'ye-es, pretty well some poetry,' alice said doubtfully. 'would you tell me which road leads out of the wood ' 'what shall i repeat to her ' said tweedledee, looking round at tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing alice's question. ''the walrus and the carpenter' is the longest,' tweedledum replied, giving his brother an affectionate hug. tweedledee began instantly: 'the sun was shining ' here alice ventured to interrupt him. 'if it's very long,' she said, as politely as she could, 'would you please tell me first which road ' tweedledee smiled gently, and began again: 'the sun was shining on the sea, shining with all his might: he did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright and this was odd, because it was the middle of the night. the moon was shining sulkily, because she thought the sun had got no business to be there after the day was done 'it's very rude of him,' she said, 'to come and spoil the fun ' the sea was wet as wet could be, the sands were dry as dry. you could not see a cloud, because no cloud was in the sky: no birds were flying over head there were no birds to fly. the walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand; they wept like anything to see such quantities of sand: 'if this were only cleared away,' they said, 'it would be grand ' 'if seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year, do you suppose,' the walrus said, 'that they could get it clear ' 'i doubt it,' said the carpenter, and shed a bitter tear. 'o oysters, come and walk with us ' the walrus did beseech. 'a pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, along the briny beach: we cannot do with more than four, to give a hand to each.' the eldest oyster looked at him. but never a word he said: the eldest oyster winked his eye, and shook his heavy head meaning to say he did not choose to leave the oyster-bed. but four young oysters hurried up, all eager for the treat: their coats were brushed, their faces washed, their shoes were clean and neat and this was odd, because, you know, they hadn't any feet. four other oysters followed them, and yet another four; and thick and fast they came at last, and more, and more, and more all hopping through the frothy waves, and scrambling to the shore. the walrus and the carpenter walked on a mile or so, and then they rested on a rock conveniently low: and all the little oysters stood and waited in a row. 'the time has come,' the walrus said, 'to talk of many things: of shoes and ships and sealing-wax of cabbages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings.' 'but wait a bit,' the oysters cried, 'before we have our chat; for some of us are out of breath, and all of us are fat ' 'no hurry ' said the carpenter. they thanked him much for that. 'a loaf of bread,' the walrus said, 'is what we chiefly need: pepper and vinegar besides are very good indeed now if you're ready oysters dear, we can begin to feed.' 'but not on us ' the oysters cried, turning a little blue, 'after such kindness, that would be a dismal thing to do ' 'the night is fine,' the walrus said 'do you admire the view 'it was so kind of you to come and you are very nice ' the carpenter said nothing but 'cut us another slice: i wish you were not quite so deaf i've had to ask you twice ' 'it seems a shame,' the walrus said, 'to play them such a trick, after we've brought them out so far, and made them trot so quick ' the carpenter said nothing but 'the butter's spread too thick ' 'i weep for you,' the walrus said. 'i deeply sympathize.' with sobs and tears he sorted out those of the largest size. holding his pocket handkerchief before his streaming eyes. 'o oysters,' said the carpenter. 'you've had a pleasant run shall we be trotting home again ' but answer came there none and that was scarcely odd, because they'd eaten every one.' 'i like the walrus best,' said alice: 'because you see he was a little sorry for the poor oysters.' 'he ate more than the carpenter, though,' said tweedledee. 'you see he held his handkerchief in front, so that the carpenter couldn't count how many he took: contrariwise.' 'that was mean ' alice said indignantly. 'then i like the carpenter best if he didn't eat so many as the walrus.' 'but he ate as many as he could get,' said tweedledum. this was a puzzler. after a pause, alice began, 'well they were both very unpleasant characters ' here she checked herself in some alarm, at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely to be a wild beast. 'are there any lions or tigers about here ' she asked timidly. 'it's only the red king snoring,' said tweedledee. 'come and look at him ' the brothers cried, and they each took one of alice's hands, and led her up to where the king was sleeping. 'isn't he a lovely sight ' said tweedledum. alice couldn't say honestly that he was. he had a tall red night-cap on, with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap, and snoring loud 'fit to snore his head off ' as tweedledum remarked. 'i'm afraid he'll catch cold with lying on the damp grass,' said alice, who was a very thoughtful little girl. 'he's dreaming now,' said tweedledee: 'and what do you think he's dreaming about ' alice said 'nobody can guess that.' 'why, about you ' tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands triumphantly. 'and if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be ' 'where i am now, of course,' said alice. 'not you ' tweedledee retorted contemptuously. 'you'd be nowhere. why, you're only a sort of thing in his dream ' 'if that there king was to wake,' added tweedledum, 'you'd go out bang just like a candle ' 'i shouldn't ' alice exclaimed indignantly. 'besides, if i'm only a sort of thing in his dream, what are you, i should like to know ' 'ditto' said tweedledum. 'ditto, ditto' cried tweedledee. he shouted this so loud that alice couldn't help saying, 'hush you'll be waking him, i'm afraid, if you make so much noise.' 'well, it no use your talking about waking him,' said tweedledum, 'when you're only one of the things in his dream. you know very well you're not real.' 'i am real ' said alice and began to cry. 'you won't make yourself a bit realler by crying,' tweedledee remarked: 'there's nothing to cry about.' 'if i wasn't real,' alice said half-laughing through her tears, it all seemed so ridiculous 'i shouldn't be able to cry.' 'i hope you don't suppose those are real tears ' tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great contempt. 'i know they're talking nonsense,' alice thought to herself: 'and it's foolish to cry about it.' so she brushed away her tears, and went on as cheerfully as she could. 'at any rate i'd better be getting out of the wood, for really it's coming on very dark. do you think it's going to rain ' tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and looked up into it. 'no, i don't think it is,' he said: 'at least not under here. nohow.' 'but it may rain outside ' 'it may if it chooses,' said tweedledee: 'we've no objection. contrariwise.' 'selfish things ' thought alice, and she was just going to say 'good-night' and leave them, when tweedledum sprang out from under the umbrella and seized her by the wrist. 'do you see that ' he said, in a voice choking with passion, and his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree. 'it's only a rattle,' alice said, after a careful examination of the little white thing. 'not a rattlesnake, you know,' she added hastily, thinking that he was frightened: 'only an old rattle quite old and broken.' 'i knew it was ' cried tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and tear his hair. 'it's spoilt, of course ' here he looked at tweedledee, who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under the umbrella. alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, 'you needn't be so angry about an old rattle.' 'but it isn't old ' tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever. 'it's new, i tell you i bought it yesterday my nice new rattle ' and his voice rose to a perfect scream. all this time tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella, with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it quite took off alice's attention from the angry brother. but he couldn't quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting his mouth and his large eyes 'looking more like a fish than anything else,' alice thought. 'of course you agree to have a battle ' tweedledum said in a calmer tone. 'i suppose so,' the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the umbrella: 'only she must help us to dress up, you know.' so the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned in a minute with their arms full of things such as bolsters, blankets, hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. 'i hope you're a good hand at pinning and tying strings ' tweedledum remarked. 'every one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other.' alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything in all her life the way those two bustled about and the quantity of things they put on and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and fastening buttons 'really they'll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else, by the time they're ready ' she said to herself, as she arranged a bolster round the neck of tweedledee, 'to keep his head from being cut off,' as he said. 'you know,' he added very gravely, 'it's one of the most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battle to get one's head cut off.' alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear of hurting his feelings. 'do i look very pale ' said tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet tied on. (he called it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more like a saucepan.) 'well yes a little,' alice replied gently. 'i'm very brave generally,' he went on in a low voice: 'only to-day i happen to have a headache.' 'and i've got a toothache ' said tweedledee, who had overheard the remark. 'i'm far worse off than you ' 'then you'd better not fight to-day,' said alice, thinking it a good opportunity to make peace. 'we must have a bit of a fight, but i don't care about going on long,' said tweedledum. 'what's the time now ' tweedledee looked at his watch, and said 'half-past four.' 'let's fight till six, and then have dinner,' said tweedledum. 'very well,' the other said, rather sadly: 'and she can watch us only you'd better not come very close,' he added: 'i generally hit everything i can see when i get really excited.' 'and i hit everything within reach,' cried tweedledum, 'whether i can see it or not ' alice laughed. 'you must hit the trees pretty often, i should think,' she said. tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. 'i don't suppose,' he said, 'there'll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by the time we've finished ' 'and all about a rattle ' said alice, still hoping to make them a little ashamed of fighting for such a trifle. 'i shouldn't have minded it so much,' said tweedledum, 'if it hadn't been a new one.' 'i wish the monstrous crow would come ' thought alice. 'there's only one sword, you know,' tweedledum said to his brother: 'but you can have the umbrella it's quite as sharp. only we must begin quick. it's getting as dark as it can.' 'and darker,' said tweedledee. it was getting dark so suddenly that alice thought there must be a thunderstorm coming on. 'what a thick black cloud that is ' she said. 'and how fast it comes why, i do believe it's got wings ' 'it's the crow ' tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment. alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree. 'it can never get at me here,' she thought: 'it's far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees. but i wish it wouldn't flap its wings so it makes quite a hurricane in the wood here's somebody's shawl being blown away ' she caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in another moment the white queen came running wildly through the wood, with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and alice very civilly went to meet her with the shawl. 'i'm very glad i happened to be in the way,' alice said, as she helped her to put on her shawl again. the white queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way, and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like 'bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,' and alice felt that if there was to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. so she began rather timidly: 'am i addressing the white queen ' 'well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,' the queen said. 'it isn't my notion of the thing, at all.' alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very beginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, 'if your majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, i'll do it as well as i can.' 'but i don't want it done at all ' groaned the poor queen. 'i've been a-dressing myself for the last two hours.' it would have been all the better, as it seemed to alice, if she had got some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy. 'every single thing's crooked,' alice thought to herself, 'and she's all over pins may i put your shawl straight for you ' she added aloud. 'i don't know what's the matter with it ' the queen said, in a melancholy voice. 'it's out of temper, i think. i've pinned it here, and i've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it ' 'it can't go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side,' alice said, as she gently put it right for her; 'and, dear me, what a state your hair is in ' 'the brush has got entangled in it ' the queen said with a sigh. 'and i lost the comb yesterday.' alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair into order. 'come, you look rather better now ' she said, after altering most of the pins. 'but really you should have a lady's maid ' 'i'm sure i'll take you with pleasure ' the queen said. 'twopence a week, and jam every other day.' alice couldn't help laughing, as she said, 'i don't want you to hire me and i don't care for jam.' 'it's very good jam,' said the queen. 'well, i don't want any to-day, at any rate.' 'you couldn't have it if you did want it,' the queen said. 'the rule is, jam to-morrow and jam yesterday but never jam to-day.' 'it must come sometimes to 'jam to-day,'' alice objected. 'no, it can't,' said the queen. 'it's jam every other day: to-day isn't any other day, you know.' 'i don't understand you,' said alice. 'it's dreadfully confusing ' 'that's the effect of living backwards,' the queen said kindly: 'it always makes one a little giddy at first ' 'living backwards ' alice repeated in great astonishment. 'i never heard of such a thing ' ' but there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both ways.' 'i'm sure mine only works one way,' alice remarked. 'i can't remember things before they happen.' 'it's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,' the queen remarked. 'what sort of things do you remember best ' alice ventured to ask. 'oh, things that happened the week after next,' the queen replied in a careless tone. 'for instance, now,' she went on, sticking a large piece of plaster on her finger as she spoke, 'there's the king's messenger. he's in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn't even begin till next wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of all.' 'suppose he never commits the crime ' said alice. 'that would be all the better, wouldn't it ' the queen said, as she bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon. alice felt there was no denying that. 'of course it would be all the better,' she said: 'but it wouldn't be all the better his being punished.' 'you're wrong there, at any rate,' said the queen: 'were you ever punished ' 'only for faults,' said alice. 'and you were all the better for it, i know ' the queen said triumphantly. 'yes, but then i had done the things i was punished for,' said alice: 'that makes all the difference.' 'but if you hadn't done them,' the queen said, 'that would have been better still; better, and better, and better ' her voice went higher with each 'better,' till it got quite to a squeak at last. alice was just beginning to say 'there's a mistake somewhere ,' when the queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence unfinished. 'oh, oh, oh ' shouted the queen, shaking her hand about as if she wanted to shake it off. 'my finger's bleeding oh, oh, oh, oh ' her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that alice had to hold both her hands over her ears. 'what is the matter ' she said, as soon as there was a chance of making herself heard. 'have you pricked your finger ' 'i haven't pricked it yet,' the queen said, 'but i soon shall oh, oh, oh ' 'when do you expect to do it ' alice asked, feeling very much inclined to laugh. 'when i fasten my shawl again,' the poor queen groaned out: 'the brooch will come undone directly. oh, oh ' as she said the words the brooch flew open, and the queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it again. 'take care ' cried alice. 'you're holding it all crooked ' and she caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the queen had pricked her finger. 'that accounts for the bleeding, you see,' she said to alice with a smile. 'now you understand the way things happen here.' 'but why don't you scream now ' alice asked, holding her hands ready to put over her ears again. 'why, i've done all the screaming already,' said the queen. 'what would be the good of having it all over again ' by this time it was getting light. 'the crow must have flown away, i think,' said alice: 'i'm so glad it's gone. i thought it was the night coming on.' 'i wish i could manage to be glad ' the queen said. 'only i never can remember the rule. you must be very happy, living in this wood, and being glad whenever you like ' 'only it is so very lonely here ' alice said in a melancholy voice; and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her cheeks. 'oh, don't go on like that ' cried the poor queen, wringing her hands in despair. 'consider what a great girl you are. consider what a long way you've come to-day. consider what o'clock it is. consider anything, only don't cry ' alice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears. 'can you keep from crying by considering things ' she asked. 'that's the way it's done,' the queen said with great decision: 'nobody can do two things at once, you know. let's consider your age to begin with how old are you ' 'i'm seven and a half exactly.' 'you needn't say 'exactually,'' the queen remarked: 'i can believe it without that. now i'll give you something to believe. i'm just one hundred and one, five months and a day.' 'i can't believe that ' said alice. 'can't you ' the queen said in a pitying tone. 'try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.' alice laughed. 'there's no use trying,' she said: 'one can't believe impossible things.' 'i daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the queen. 'when i was your age, i always did it for half-an-hour a day. why, sometimes i've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. there goes the shawl again ' the brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew the queen's shawl across a little brook. the queen spread out her arms again, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in catching it for herself. 'i've got it ' she cried in a triumphant tone. 'now you shall see me pin it on again, all by myself ' 'then i hope your finger is better now ' alice said very politely, as she crossed the little brook after the queen. 'oh, much better ' cried the queen, her voice rising to a squeak as she went on. 'much be-etter be-etter be-e-e-etter be-e-ehh ' the last word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that alice quite started. she looked at the queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool. alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. she couldn't make out what had happened at all. was she in a shop and was that really was it really a sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter rub as she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was an old sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles. 'what is it you want to buy ' the sheep said at last, looking up for a moment from her knitting. 'i don't quite know yet,' alice said, very gently. 'i should like to look all round me first, if i might.' 'you may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,' said the sheep: 'but you can't look all round you unless you've got eyes at the back of your head.' but these, as it happened, alice had not got: so she contented herself with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them. the shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things but the oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf, to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold. 'things flow about so here ' she said at last in a plaintive tone, after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing, that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box, and was always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at. 'and this one is the most provoking of all but i'll tell you what ' she added, as a sudden thought struck her, 'i'll follow it up to the very top shelf of all. it'll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, i expect ' but even this plan failed: the 'thing' went through the ceiling as quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it. 'are you a child or a teetotum ' the sheep said, as she took up another pair of needles. 'you'll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round like that.' she was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and alice couldn't help looking at her in great astonishment. 'how can she knit with so many ' the puzzled child thought to herself. 'she gets more and more like a porcupine every minute ' 'can you row ' the sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles as she spoke. 'yes, a little but not on land and not with needles ' alice was beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best. 'feather ' cried the sheep, as she took up another pair of needles. this didn't sound like a remark that needed any answer, so alice said nothing, but pulled away. there was something very queer about the water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and would hardly come out again. 'feather feather ' the sheep cried again, taking more needles. 'you'll be catching a crab directly.' 'a dear little crab ' thought alice. 'i should like that.' 'didn't you hear me say 'feather' ' the sheep cried angrily, taking up quite a bunch of needles. 'indeed i did,' said alice: 'you've said it very often and very loud. please, where are the crabs ' 'in the water, of course ' said the sheep, sticking some of the needles into her hair, as her hands were full. 'feather, i say ' 'why do you say 'feather' so often ' alice asked at last, rather vexed. 'i'm not a bird ' 'you are,' said the sheep: 'you're a little goose.' this offended alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever), and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks frowning over their heads. 'oh, please there are some scented rushes ' alice cried in a sudden transport of delight. 'there really are and such beauties ' 'you needn't say 'please' to me about 'em,' the sheep said, without looking up from her knitting: 'i didn't put 'em there, and i'm not going to take 'em away.' 'no, but i meant please, may we wait and pick some ' alice pleaded. 'if you don't mind stopping the boat for a minute.' 'how am i to stop it ' said the sheep. 'if you leave off rowing, it'll stop of itself.' so the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it glided gently in among the waving rushes. and then the little sleeves were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off and for a while alice forgot all about the sheep and the knitting, as she bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the water while with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes. 'i only hope the boat won't tipple over ' she said to herself. 'oh, what a lovely one only i couldn't quite reach it.' 'and it certainly did seem a little provoking ('almost as if it happened on purpose,' she thought) that, though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as the boat glided by, there was always a more lovely one that she couldn't reach. 'the prettiest are always further ' she said at last, with a sigh at the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed cheeks and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place, and began to arrange her new-found treasures. what mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade, and to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she picked them even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very little while and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, as they lay in heaps at her feet but alice hardly noticed this, there were so many other curious things to think about. they hadn't gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got fast in the water and wouldn't come out again (so alice explained it afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of 'oh, oh, oh ' from poor alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among the heap of rushes. however, she wasn't hurt, and was soon up again: the sheep went on with her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. 'that was a nice crab you caught ' she remarked, as alice got back into her place, very much relieved to find herself still in the boat. 'was it i didn't see it,' said alice, peeping cautiously over the side of the boat into the dark water. 'i wish it hadn't let go i should so like to see a little crab to take home with me ' but the sheep only laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting. 'are there many crabs here ' said alice. 'crabs, and all sorts of things,' said the sheep: 'plenty of choice, only make up your mind. now, what do you want to buy ' 'to buy ' alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half frightened for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop. 'i should like to buy an egg, please,' she said timidly. 'how do you sell them ' 'fivepence farthing for one twopence for two,' the sheep replied. 'then two are cheaper than one ' alice said in a surprised tone, taking out her purse. 'only you must eat them both, if you buy two,' said the sheep. 'then i'll have one, please,' said alice, as she put the money down on the counter. for she thought to herself, 'they mightn't be at all nice, you know.' the sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said 'i never put things into people's hands that would never do you must get it for yourself.' and so saying, she went off to the other end of the shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf. 'i wonder why it wouldn't do ' thought alice, as she groped her way among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the end. 'the egg seems to get further away the more i walk towards it. let me see, is this a chair why, it's got branches, i declare how very odd to find trees growing here and actually here's a little brook well, this is the very queerest shop i ever saw ' so she went on, wondering more and more at every step, as everything turned into a tree the moment she came up to it, and she quite expected the egg to do the same. chapter vi. humpty dumpty however, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more human: when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it, she saw clearly that it was humpty dumpty himself. 'it can't be anybody else ' she said to herself. 'i'm as certain of it, as if his name were written all over his face.' it might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous face. humpty dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a turk, on the top of a high wall such a narrow one that alice quite wondered how he could keep his balance and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction, and he didn't take the least notice of her, she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all. 'and how exactly like an egg he is ' she said aloud, standing with her hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to fall. 'it's very provoking,' humpty dumpty said after a long silence, looking away from alice as he spoke, 'to be called an egg very ' 'i said you looked like an egg, sir,' alice gently explained. 'and some eggs are very pretty, you know' she added, hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment. 'some people,' said humpty dumpty, looking away from her as usual, 'have no more sense than a baby ' alice didn't know what to say to this: it wasn't at all like conversation, she thought, as he never said anything to her; in fact, his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree so she stood and softly repeated to herself: 'humpty dumpty sat on a wall: humpty dumpty had a great fall. all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put humpty dumpty in his place again.' 'that last line is much too long for the poetry,' she added, almost out loud, forgetting that humpty dumpty would hear her. 'don't stand there chattering to yourself like that,' humpty dumpty said, looking at her for the first time, 'but tell me your name and your business.' 'my name is alice, but ' 'it's a stupid enough name ' humpty dumpty interrupted impatiently. 'what does it mean ' 'must a name mean something ' alice asked doubtfully. 'of course it must,' humpty dumpty said with a short laugh: 'my name means the shape i am and a good handsome shape it is, too. with a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.' 'why do you sit out here all alone ' said alice, not wishing to begin an argument. 'why, because there's nobody with me ' cried humpty dumpty. 'did you think i didn't know the answer to that ask another.' 'don't you think you'd be safer down on the ground ' alice went on, not with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured anxiety for the queer creature. 'that wall is so very narrow ' 'what tremendously easy riddles you ask ' humpty dumpty growled out. 'of course i don't think so why, if ever i did fall off which there's no chance of but if i did ' here he pursed up his lips and looked so solemn and grand that alice could hardly help laughing. 'if i did fall,' he went on, 'the king has promised me ah, you may turn pale, if you like you didn't think i was going to say that, did you the king has promised me with his very own mouth to to ' 'to send all his horses and all his men,' alice interrupted, rather unwisely. 'now i declare that's too bad ' humpty dumpty cried, breaking into a sudden passion. 'you've been listening at doors and behind trees and down chimneys or you couldn't have known it ' 'i haven't, indeed ' alice said very gently. 'it's in a book.' 'ah, well they may write such things in a book,' humpty dumpty said in a calmer tone. 'that's what you call a history of england, that is. now, take a good look at me i'm one that has spoken to a king, i am: mayhap you'll never see such another: and to show you i'm not proud, you may shake hands with me ' and he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so) and offered alice his hand. she watched him a little anxiously as she took it. 'if he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet behind,' she thought: 'and then i don't know what would happen to his head i'm afraid it would come off ' 'yes, all his horses and all his men,' humpty dumpty went on. 'they'd pick me up again in a minute, they would however, this conversation is going on a little too fast: let's go back to the last remark but one.' 'i'm afraid i can't quite remember it,' alice said very politely. 'in that case we start fresh,' said humpty dumpty, 'and it's my turn to choose a subject ' ('he talks about it just as if it was a game ' thought alice.) 'so here's a question for you. how old did you say you were ' alice made a short calculation, and said 'seven years and six months.' 'wrong ' humpty dumpty exclaimed triumphantly. 'you never said a word like it ' 'i though you meant 'how old are you '' alice explained. 'if i'd meant that, i'd have said it,' said humpty dumpty. alice didn't want to begin another argument, so she said nothing. 'seven years and six months ' humpty dumpty repeated thoughtfully. 'an uncomfortable sort of age. now if you'd asked my advice, i'd have said 'leave off at seven' but it's too late now.' 'i never ask advice about growing,' alice said indignantly. 'too proud ' the other inquired. alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. 'i mean,' she said, 'that one can't help growing older.' 'one can't, perhaps,' said humpty dumpty, 'but two can. with proper assistance, you might have left off at seven.' 'what a beautiful belt you've got on ' alice suddenly remarked. (they had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn now.) 'at least,' she corrected herself on second thoughts, 'a beautiful cravat, i should have said no, a belt, i mean i beg your pardon ' she added in dismay, for humpty dumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she began to wish she hadn't chosen that subject. 'if i only knew,' she thought to herself, 'which was neck and which was waist ' evidently humpty dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a minute or two. when he did speak again, it was in a deep growl. 'it is a most provoking thing,' he said at last, 'when a person doesn't know a cravat from a belt ' 'i know it's very ignorant of me,' alice said, in so humble a tone that humpty dumpty relented. 'it's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. it's a present from the white king and queen. there now ' 'is it really ' said alice, quite pleased to find that she had chosen a good subject, after all. 'they gave it me,' humpty dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, 'they gave it me for an un-birthday present.' 'i beg your pardon ' alice said with a puzzled air. 'i'm not offended,' said humpty dumpty. 'i mean, what is an un-birthday present ' 'a present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.' alice considered a little. 'i like birthday presents best,' she said at last. 'you don't know what you're talking about ' cried humpty dumpty. 'how many days are there in a year ' 'three hundred and sixty-five,' said alice. 'and how many birthdays have you ' 'one.' 'and if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what remains ' 'three hundred and sixty-four, of course.' humpty dumpty looked doubtful. 'i'd rather see that done on paper,' he said. alice couldn't help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and worked the sum for him: humpty dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully. 'that seems to be done right ' he began. 'you're holding it upside down ' alice interrupted. 'to be sure i was ' humpty dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round for him. 'i thought it looked a little queer. as i was saying, that seems to be done right though i haven't time to look it over thoroughly just now and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents ' 'certainly,' said alice. 'and only one for birthday presents, you know. there's glory for you ' 'i don't know what you mean by 'glory,'' alice said. humpty dumpty smiled contemptuously. 'of course you don't till i tell you. i meant 'there's a nice knock-down argument for you '' 'but 'glory' doesn't mean 'a nice knock-down argument,'' alice objected. 'when i use a word,' humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, 'it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less.' 'the question is,' said alice, 'whether you can make words mean so many different things.' 'the question is,' said humpty dumpty, 'which is to be master that's all.' alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute humpty dumpty began again. 'they've a temper, some of them particularly verbs, they're the proudest adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs however, i can manage the whole lot of them impenetrability that's what i say ' 'would you tell me, please,' said alice 'what that means ' 'now you talk like a reasonable child,' said humpty dumpty, looking very much pleased. 'i meant by 'impenetrability' that we've had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you mean to do next, as i suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.' 'that's a great deal to make one word mean,' alice said in a thoughtful tone. 'when i make a word do a lot of work like that,' said humpty dumpty, 'i always pay it extra.' 'oh ' said alice. she was too much puzzled to make any other remark. 'ah, you should see 'em come round me of a saturday night,' humpty dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: 'for to get their wages, you know.' (alice didn't venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see i can't tell you.) 'you seem very clever at explaining words, sir,' said alice. 'would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called 'jabberwocky' ' 'let's hear it,' said humpty dumpty. 'i can explain all the poems that were ever invented and a good many that haven't been invented just yet.' this sounded very hopeful, so alice repeated the first verse: 'twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe; all mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgrabe. 'that's enough to begin with,' humpty dumpty interrupted: 'there are plenty of hard words there. 'brillig' means four o'clock in the afternoon the time when you begin broiling things for dinner.' 'that'll do very well,' said alice: 'and 'slithy' ' 'well, 'slithy' means 'lithe and slimy.' 'lithe' is the same as 'active.' you see it's like a portmanteau there are two meanings packed up into one word.' 'i see it now,' alice remarked thoughtfully: 'and what are 'toves' ' 'well, 'toves' are something like badgers they're something like lizards and they're something like corkscrews.' 'they must be very curious looking creatures.' 'they are that,' said humpty dumpty: 'also they make their nests under sun-dials also they live on cheese.' 'and what's the 'gyre' and to 'gimble' ' 'to 'gyre' is to go round and round like a gyroscope. to 'gimble' is to make holes like a gimlet.' 'and 'the wabe' is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, i suppose ' said alice, surprised at her own ingenuity. 'of course it is. it's called 'wabe,' you know, because it goes a long way before it, and a long way behind it ' 'and a long way beyond it on each side,' alice added. 'exactly so. well, then, 'mimsy' is 'flimsy and miserable' (there's another portmanteau for you). and a 'borogove' is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round something like a live mop.' 'and then 'mome raths' ' said alice. 'i'm afraid i'm giving you a great deal of trouble.' 'well, a 'rath' is a sort of green pig: but 'mome' i'm not certain about. i think it's short for 'from home' meaning that they'd lost their way, you know.' 'and what does 'outgrabe' mean ' 'well, 'outgrabing' is something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you'll hear it done, maybe down in the wood yonder and when you've once heard it you'll be quite content. who's been repeating all that hard stuff to you ' 'i read it in a book,' said alice. 'but i had some poetry repeated to me, much easier than that, by tweedledee, i think it was.' 'as to poetry, you know,' said humpty dumpty, stretching out one of his great hands, ' i can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes to that ' 'oh, it needn't come to that ' alice hastily said, hoping to keep him from beginning. 'the piece i'm going to repeat,' he went on without noticing her remark, 'was written entirely for your amusement.' alice felt that in that case she really ought to listen to it, so she sat down, and said 'thank you' rather sadly. 'in winter, when the fields are white, i sing this song for your delight only i don't sing it,' he added, as an explanation. 'i see you don't,' said alice. 'if you can see whether i'm singing or not, you've sharper eyes than most.' humpty dumpty remarked severely. alice was silent. 'in spring, when woods are getting green, i'll try and tell you what i mean.' 'thank you very much,' said alice. 'in summer, when the days are long, perhaps you'll understand the song: in autumn, when the leaves are brown, take pen and ink, and write it down.' 'i will, if i can remember it so long,' said alice. 'you needn't go on making remarks like that,' humpty dumpty said: 'they're not sensible, and they put me out.' 'i sent a message to the fish: i told them 'this is what i wish.' the little fishes of the sea, they sent an answer back to me. the little fishes' answer was 'we cannot do it, sir, because '' 'i'm afraid i don't quite understand,' said alice. 'it gets easier further on,' humpty dumpty replied. 'i sent to them again to say 'it will be better to obey.' the fishes answered with a grin, 'why, what a temper you are in ' i told them once, i told them twice: they would not listen to advice. i took a kettle large and new, fit for the deed i had to do. my heart went hop, my heart went thump; i filled the kettle at the pump. then some one came to me and said, 'the little fishes are in bed.' i said to him, i said it plain, 'then you must wake them up again.' i said it very loud and clear; i went and shouted in his ear.' humpty dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this verse, and alice thought with a shudder, 'i wouldn't have been the messenger for anything ' 'but he was very stiff and proud; he said 'you needn't shout so loud ' and he was very proud and stiff; he said 'i'd go and wake them, if ' i took a corkscrew from the shelf: i went to wake them up myself. and when i found the door was locked, i pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked. and when i found the door was shut, i tried to turn the handle, but ' there was a long pause. 'is that all ' alice timidly asked. 'that's all,' said humpty dumpty. 'good-bye.' this was rather sudden, alice thought: but, after such a very strong hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil to stay. so she got up, and held out her hand. 'good-bye, till we meet again ' she said as cheerfully as she could. 'i shouldn't know you again if we did meet,' humpty dumpty replied in a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake; 'you're so exactly like other people.' 'the face is what one goes by, generally,' alice remarked in a thoughtful tone. 'that's just what i complain of,' said humpty dumpty. 'your face is the same as everybody has the two eyes, so ' (marking their places in the air with this thumb) 'nose in the middle, mouth under. it's always the same. now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for instance or the mouth at the top that would be some help.' 'it wouldn't look nice,' alice objected. but humpty dumpty only shut his eyes and said 'wait till you've tried.' alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said 'good-bye ' once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away: but she couldn't help saying to herself as she went, 'of all the unsatisfactory ' (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to have such a long word to say) 'of all the unsatisfactory people i ever met ' she never finished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash shook the forest from end to end. the next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in twos and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowds that they seemed to fill the whole forest. alice got behind a tree, for fear of being run over, and watched them go by. she thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or other, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him, so that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men. then came the horses. having four feet, these managed rather better than the foot-soldiers: but even they stumbled now and then; and it seemed to be a regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off instantly. the confusion got worse every moment, and alice was very glad to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found the white king seated on the ground, busily writing in his memorandum-book. 'i've sent them all ' the king cried in a tone of delight, on seeing alice. 'did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came through the wood ' 'yes, i did,' said alice: 'several thousand, i should think.' 'four thousand two hundred and seven, that's the exact number,' the king said, referring to his book. 'i couldn't send all the horses, you know, because two of them are wanted in the game. and i haven't sent the two messengers, either. they're both gone to the town. just look along the road, and tell me if you can see either of them.' 'i see nobody on the road,' said alice. 'i only wish i had such eyes,' the king remarked in a fretful tone. 'to be able to see nobody and at that distance, too why, it's as much as i can do to see real people, by this light ' all this was lost on alice, who was still looking intently along the road, shading her eyes with one hand. 'i see somebody now ' she exclaimed at last. 'but he's coming very slowly and what curious attitudes he goes into ' (for the messenger kept skipping up and down, and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spread out like fans on each side.) 'not at all,' said the king. 'he's an anglo-saxon messenger and those are anglo-saxon attitudes. he only does them when he's happy. his name is haigha.' (he pronounced it so as to rhyme with 'mayor.') 'i love my love with an h,' alice couldn't help beginning, 'because he is happy. i hate him with an h, because he is hideous. i fed him with with with ham-sandwiches and hay. his name is haigha, and he lives ' 'he lives on the hill,' the king remarked simply, without the least idea that he was joining in the game, while alice was still hesitating for the name of a town beginning with h. 'the other messenger's called hatta. i must have two, you know to come and go. one to come, and one to go.' 'i beg your pardon ' said alice. 'it isn't respectable to beg,' said the king. 'i only meant that i didn't understand,' said alice. 'why one to come and one to go ' 'didn't i tell you ' the king repeated impatiently. 'i must have two to fetch and carry. one to fetch, and one to carry.' at this moment the messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and make the most fearful faces at the poor king. 'this young lady loves you with an h,' the king said, introducing alice in the hope of turning off the messenger's attention from himself but it was no use the anglo-saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side. 'you alarm me ' said the king. 'i feel faint give me a ham sandwich ' on which the messenger, to alice's great amusement, opened a bag that hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the king, who devoured it greedily. 'another sandwich ' said the king. 'there's nothing but hay left now,' the messenger said, peeping into the bag. 'hay, then,' the king murmured in a faint whisper. alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. 'there's nothing like eating hay when you're faint,' he remarked to her, as he munched away. 'i should think throwing cold water over you would be better,' alice suggested: 'or some sal-volatile.' 'i didn't say there was nothing better,' the king replied. 'i said there was nothing like it.' which alice did not venture to deny. 'who did you pass on the road ' the king went on, holding out his hand to the messenger for some more hay. 'nobody,' said the messenger. 'quite right,' said the king: 'this young lady saw him too. so of course nobody walks slower than you.' 'i do my best,' the messenger said in a sulky tone. 'i'm sure nobody walks much faster than i do ' 'he can't do that,' said the king, 'or else he'd have been here first. however, now you've got your breath, you may tell us what's happened in the town.' 'i'll whisper it,' said the messenger, putting his hands to his mouth in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the king's ear. alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too. however, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his voice 'they're at it again ' 'do you call that a whisper ' cried the poor king, jumping up and shaking himself. 'if you do such a thing again, i'll have you buttered it went through and through my head like an earthquake ' 'it would have to be a very tiny earthquake ' thought alice. 'who are at it again ' she ventured to ask. 'why the lion and the unicorn, of course,' said the king. 'fighting for the crown ' 'yes, to be sure,' said the king: 'and the best of the joke is, that it's my crown all the while let's run and see them.' and they trotted off, alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the old song: 'the lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown: the lion beat the unicorn all round the town. some gave them white bread, some gave them brown; some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.' 'does the one that wins get the crown ' she asked, as well as she could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath. 'dear me, no ' said the king. 'what an idea ' 'would you be good enough,' alice panted out, after running a little further, 'to stop a minute just to get one's breath again ' 'i'm good enough,' the king said, 'only i'm not strong enough. you see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick. you might as well try to stop a bandersnatch ' alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence, till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the lion and unicorn were fighting. they were in such a cloud of dust, that at first alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed to distinguish the unicorn by his horn. they placed themselves close to where hatta, the other messenger, was standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'he's only just out of prison, and he hadn't finished his tea when he was sent in,' haigha whispered to alice: 'and they only give them oyster-shells in there so you see he's very hungry and thirsty. how are you, dear child ' he went on, putting his arm affectionately round hatta's neck. hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter. 'were you happy in prison, dear child ' said haigha. hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down his cheek: but not a word would he say. 'speak, can't you ' haigha cried impatiently. but hatta only munched away, and drank some more tea. 'speak, won't you ' cried the king. 'how are they getting on with the fight ' hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of bread-and-butter. 'they're getting on very well,' he said in a choking voice: 'each of them has been down about eighty-seven times.' 'then i suppose they'll soon bring the white bread and the brown ' alice ventured to remark. 'it's waiting for 'em now,' said hatta: 'this is a bit of it as i'm eating.' there was a pause in the fight just then, and the lion and the unicorn sat down, panting, while the king called out 'ten minutes allowed for refreshments ' haigha and hatta set to work at once, carrying rough trays of white and brown bread. alice took a piece to taste, but it was very dry. 'i don't think they'll fight any more to-day,' the king said to hatta: 'go and order the drums to begin.' and hatta went bounding away like a grasshopper. for a minute or two alice stood silent, watching him. suddenly she brightened up. 'look, look ' she cried, pointing eagerly. 'there's the white queen running across the country she came flying out of the wood over yonder how fast those queens can run ' 'there's some enemy after her, no doubt,' the king said, without even looking round. 'that wood's full of them.' 'but aren't you going to run and help her ' alice asked, very much surprised at his taking it so quietly. 'no use, no use ' said the king. 'she runs so fearfully quick. you might as well try to catch a bandersnatch but i'll make a memorandum about her, if you like she's a dear good creature,' he repeated softly to himself, as he opened his memorandum-book. 'do you spell 'creature' with a double 'e' ' at this moment the unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his pockets. 'i had the best of it this time ' he said to the king, just glancing at him as he passed. 'a little a little,' the king replied, rather nervously. 'you shouldn't have run him through with your horn, you know.' 'it didn't hurt him,' the unicorn said carelessly, and he was going on, when his eye happened to fall upon alice: he turned round rather instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the deepest disgust. 'what is this ' he said at last. 'this is a child ' haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of alice to introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an anglo-saxon attitude. 'we only found it to-day. it's as large as life, and twice as natural ' 'i always thought they were fabulous monsters ' said the unicorn. 'is it alive ' 'it can talk,' said haigha, solemnly. the unicorn looked dreamily at alice, and said 'talk, child.' alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: 'do you know, i always thought unicorns were fabulous monsters, too i never saw one alive before ' 'well, now that we have seen each other,' said the unicorn, 'if you'll believe in me, i'll believe in you. is that a bargain ' 'yes, if you like,' said alice. 'come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man ' the unicorn went on, turning from her to the king. 'none of your brown bread for me ' 'certainly certainly ' the king muttered, and beckoned to haigha. 'open the bag ' he whispered. 'quick not that one that's full of hay ' haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to alice to hold, while he got out a dish and carving-knife. how they all came out of it alice couldn't guess. it was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought. the lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very tired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut. 'what's this ' he said, blinking lazily at alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that sounded like the tolling of a great bell. 'ah, what is it, now ' the unicorn cried eagerly. 'you'll never guess i couldn't.' the lion looked at alice wearily. 'are you animal vegetable or mineral ' he said, yawning at every other word. 'it's a fabulous monster ' the unicorn cried out, before alice could reply. 'then hand round the plum-cake, monster,' the lion said, lying down and putting his chin on his paws. 'and sit down, both of you,' (to the king and the unicorn): 'fair play with the cake, you know ' the king was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him. 'what a fight we might have for the crown, now ' the unicorn said, looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor king was nearly shaking off his head, he trembled so much. 'i should win easy,' said the lion. 'i'm not so sure of that,' said the unicorn. 'why, i beat you all round the town, you chicken ' the lion replied angrily, half getting up as he spoke. here the king interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very nervous, and his voice quite quivered. 'all round the town ' he said. 'that's a good long way. did you go by the old bridge, or the market-place you get the best view by the old bridge.' 'i'm sure i don't know,' the lion growled out as he lay down again. 'there was too much dust to see anything. what a time the monster is, cutting up that cake ' alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife. 'it's very provoking ' she said, in reply to the lion (she was getting quite used to being called 'the monster'). 'i've cut several slices already, but they always join on again ' 'you don't know how to manage looking-glass cakes,' the unicorn remarked. 'hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.' this sounded nonsense, but alice very obediently got up, and carried the dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so. 'now cut it up,' said the lion, as she returned to her place with the empty dish. 'i say, this isn't fair ' cried the unicorn, as alice sat with the knife in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin. 'the monster has given the lion twice as much as me ' 'she's kept none for herself, anyhow,' said the lion. 'do you like plum-cake, monster ' but before alice could answer him, the drums began. where the noise came from, she couldn't make out: the air seemed full of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite deafened. she started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in her terror, and had just time to see the lion and the unicorn rise to their feet, with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she dropped to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to shut out the dreadful uproar. 'if that doesn't 'drum them out of town,'' she thought to herself, 'nothing ever will ' after a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead silence, and alice lifted up her head in some alarm. there was no one to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming about the lion and the unicorn and those queer anglo-saxon messengers. however, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she had tried to cut the plum-cake, 'so i wasn't dreaming, after all,' she said to herself, 'unless unless we're all part of the same dream. only i do hope it's my dream, and not the red king's i don't like belonging to another person's dream,' she went on in a rather complaining tone: 'i've a great mind to go and wake him, and see what happens ' at this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of 'ahoy ahoy check ' and a knight dressed in crimson armour came galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club. just as he reached her, the horse stopped suddenly: 'you're my prisoner ' the knight cried, as he tumbled off his horse. startled as she was, alice was more frightened for him than for herself at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again. as soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more 'you're my ' but here another voice broke in 'ahoy ahoy check ' and alice looked round in some surprise for the new enemy. this time it was a white knight. he drew up at alice's side, and tumbled off his horse just as the red knight had done: then he got on again, and the two knights sat and looked at each other for some time without speaking. alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment. 'she's my prisoner, you know ' the red knight said at last. 'yes, but then i came and rescued her ' the white knight replied. 'well, we must fight for her, then,' said the red knight, as he took up his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something the shape of a horse's head), and put it on. 'you will observe the rules of battle, of course ' the white knight remarked, putting on his helmet too. 'i always do,' said the red knight, and they began banging away at each other with such fury that alice got behind a tree to be out of the way of the blows. 'i wonder, now, what the rules of battle are,' she said to herself, as she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: 'one rule seems to be, that if one knight hits the other, he knocks him off his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself and another rule seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were punch and judy what a noise they make when they tumble just like a whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender and how quiet the horses are they let them get on and off them just as if they were tables ' another rule of battle, that alice had not noticed, seemed to be that they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they shook hands, and then the red knight mounted and galloped off. 'it was a glorious victory, wasn't it ' said the white knight, as he came up panting. 'i don't know,' alice said doubtfully. 'i don't want to be anybody's prisoner. i want to be a queen.' 'so you will, when you've crossed the next brook,' said the white knight. 'i'll see you safe to the end of the wood and then i must go back, you know. that's the end of my move.' 'thank you very much,' said alice. 'may i help you off with your helmet ' it was evidently more than he could manage by himself; however, she managed to shake him out of it at last. 'now one can breathe more easily,' said the knight, putting back his shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face and large mild eyes to alice. she thought she had never seen such a strange-looking soldier in all her life. he was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder, upside-down, and with the lid hanging open. alice looked at it with great curiosity. 'i see you're admiring my little box.' the knight said in a friendly tone. 'it's my own invention to keep clothes and sandwiches in. you see i carry it upside-down, so that the rain can't get in.' 'but the things can get out,' alice gently remarked. 'do you know the lid's open ' 'i didn't know it,' the knight said, a shade of vexation passing over his face. 'then all the things must have fallen out and the box is no use without them.' he unfastened it as he spoke, and was just going to throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him, and he hung it carefully on a tree. 'can you guess why i did that ' he said to alice. alice shook her head. 'in hopes some bees may make a nest in it then i should get the honey.' 'but you've got a bee-hive or something like one fastened to the saddle,' said alice. 'yes, it's a very good bee-hive,' the knight said in a discontented tone, 'one of the best kind. but not a single bee has come near it yet. and the other thing is a mouse-trap. i suppose the mice keep the bees out or the bees keep the mice out, i don't know which.' 'i was wondering what the mouse-trap was for,' said alice. 'it isn't very likely there would be any mice on the horse's back.' 'not very likely, perhaps,' said the knight: 'but if they do come, i don't choose to have them running all about.' 'you see,' he went on after a pause, 'it's as well to be provided for everything. that's the reason the horse has all those anklets round his feet.' 'but what are they for ' alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. 'to guard against the bites of sharks,' the knight replied. 'it's an invention of my own. and now help me on. i'll go with you to the end of the wood what's the dish for ' 'it's meant for plum-cake,' said alice. 'we'd better take it with us,' the knight said. 'it'll come in handy if we find any plum-cake. help me to get it into this bag.' this took a very long time to manage, though alice held the bag open very carefully, because the knight was so very awkward in putting in the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself instead. 'it's rather a tight fit, you see,' he said, as they got it in a last; 'there are so many candlesticks in the bag.' and he hung it to the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and fire-irons, and many other things. 'i hope you've got your hair well fastened on ' he continued, as they set off. 'only in the usual way,' alice said, smiling. 'that's hardly enough,' he said, anxiously. 'you see the wind is so very strong here. it's as strong as soup.' 'have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off ' alice enquired. 'not yet,' said the knight. 'but i've got a plan for keeping it from falling off.' 'i should like to hear it, very much.' 'first you take an upright stick,' said the knight. 'then you make your hair creep up it, like a fruit-tree. now the reason hair falls off is because it hangs down things never fall upwards, you know. it's a plan of my own invention. you may try it if you like.' it didn't sound a comfortable plan, alice thought, and for a few minutes she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and every now and then stopping to help the poor knight, who certainly was not a good rider. whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather suddenly), he fell off behind. otherwise he kept on pretty well, except that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he generally did this on the side on which alice was walking, she soon found that it was the best plan not to walk quite close to the horse. 'i'm afraid you've not had much practice in riding,' she ventured to say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble. the knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the remark. 'what makes you say that ' he asked, as he scrambled back into the saddle, keeping hold of alice's hair with one hand, to save himself from falling over on the other side. 'because people don't fall off quite so often, when they've had much practice.' 'i've had plenty of practice,' the knight said very gravely: 'plenty of practice ' alice could think of nothing better to say than 'indeed ' but she said it as heartily as she could. they went on a little way in silence after this, the knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and alice watching anxiously for the next tumble. 'the great art of riding,' the knight suddenly began in a loud voice, waving his right arm as he spoke, 'is to keep ' here the sentence ended as suddenly as it had begun, as the knight fell heavily on the top of his head exactly in the path where alice was walking. she was quite frightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him up, 'i hope no bones are broken ' 'none to speak of,' the knight said, as if he didn't mind breaking two or three of them. 'the great art of riding, as i was saying, is to keep your balance properly. like this, you know ' he let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show alice what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the horse's feet. 'plenty of practice ' he went on repeating, all the time that alice was getting him on his feet again. 'plenty of practice ' 'it's too ridiculous ' cried alice, losing all her patience this time. 'you ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought ' 'does that kind go smoothly ' the knight asked in a tone of great interest, clasping his arms round the horse's neck as he spoke, just in time to save himself from tumbling off again. 'much more smoothly than a live horse,' alice said, with a little scream of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it. 'i'll get one,' the knight said thoughtfully to himself. 'one or two several.' there was a short silence after this, and then the knight went on again. 'i'm a great hand at inventing things. now, i daresay you noticed, that last time you picked me up, that i was looking rather thoughtful ' 'you were a little grave,' said alice. 'well, just then i was inventing a new way of getting over a gate would you like to hear it ' 'very much indeed,' alice said politely. 'i'll tell you how i came to think of it,' said the knight. 'you see, i said to myself, 'the only difficulty is with the feet: the head is high enough already.' now, first i put my head on the top of the gate then i stand on my head then the feet are high enough, you see then i'm over, you see.' 'yes, i suppose you'd be over when that was done,' alice said thoughtfully: 'but don't you think it would be rather hard ' 'i haven't tried it yet,' the knight said, gravely: 'so i can't tell for certain but i'm afraid it would be a little hard.' he looked so vexed at the idea, that alice changed the subject hastily. 'what a curious helmet you've got ' she said cheerfully. 'is that your invention too ' the knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the saddle. 'yes,' he said, 'but i've invented a better one than that like a sugar loaf. when i used to wear it, if i fell off the horse, it always touched the ground directly. so i had a very little way to fall, you see but there was the danger of falling into it, to be sure. that happened to me once and the worst of it was, before i could get out again, the other white knight came and put it on. he thought it was his own helmet.' the knight looked so solemn about it that alice did not dare to laugh. 'i'm afraid you must have hurt him,' she said in a trembling voice, 'being on the top of his head.' 'i had to kick him, of course,' the knight said, very seriously. 'and then he took the helmet off again but it took hours and hours to get me out. i was as fast as as lightning, you know.' 'but that's a different kind of fastness,' alice objected. the knight shook his head. 'it was all kinds of fastness with me, i can assure you ' he said. he raised his hands in some excitement as he said this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a deep ditch. alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. she was rather startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and she was afraid that he really was hurt this time. however, though she could see nothing but the soles of his feet, she was much relieved to hear that he was talking on in his usual tone. 'all kinds of fastness,' he repeated: 'but it was careless of him to put another man's helmet on with the man in it, too.' 'how can you go on talking so quietly, head downwards ' alice asked, as she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the bank. the knight looked surprised at the question. 'what does it matter where my body happens to be ' he said. 'my mind goes on working all the same. in fact, the more head downwards i am, the more i keep inventing new things.' 'now the cleverest thing of the sort that i ever did,' he went on after a pause, 'was inventing a new pudding during the meat-course.' 'in time to have it cooked for the next course ' said alice. 'well, not the next course,' the knight said in a slow thoughtful tone: 'no, certainly not the next course.' 'then it would have to be the next day. i suppose you wouldn't have two pudding-courses in one dinner ' 'well, not the next day,' the knight repeated as before: 'not the next day. in fact,' he went on, holding his head down, and his voice getting lower and lower, 'i don't believe that pudding ever was cooked in fact, i don't believe that pudding ever will be cooked and yet it was a very clever pudding to invent.' 'what did you mean it to be made of ' alice asked, hoping to cheer him up, for the poor knight seemed quite low-spirited about it. 'it began with blotting paper,' the knight answered with a groan. 'that wouldn't be very nice, i'm afraid ' 'not very nice alone,' he interrupted, quite eagerly: 'but you've no idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other things such as gunpowder and sealing-wax. and here i must leave you.' they had just come to the end of the wood. alice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding. 'you are sad,' the knight said in an anxious tone: 'let me sing you a song to comfort you.' 'is it very long ' alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry that day. 'it's long,' said the knight, 'but very, very beautiful. everybody that hears me sing it either it brings the tears into their eyes, or else ' 'or else what ' said alice, for the knight had made a sudden pause. 'or else it doesn't, you know. the name of the song is called 'haddocks' eyes.'' 'oh, that's the name of the song, is it ' alice said, trying to feel interested. 'no, you don't understand,' the knight said, looking a little vexed. 'that's what the name is called. the name really is 'the aged aged man.'' 'then i ought to have said 'that's what the song is called' ' alice corrected herself. 'no, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing the song is called 'ways and means': but that's only what it's called, you know ' 'well, what is the song, then ' said alice, who was by this time completely bewildered. 'i was coming to that,' the knight said. 'the song really is 'a-sitting on a gate': and the tune's my own invention.' so saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck: then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile lighting up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his song, he began. of all the strange things that alice saw in her journey through the looking-glass, this was the one that she always remembered most clearly. years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, as if it had been only yesterday the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the knight the setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her the horse quietly moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the grass at her feet and the black shadows of the forest behind all this she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and listening, in a half dream, to the melancholy music of the song. 'but the tune isn't his own invention,' she said to herself: 'it's 'i give thee all, i can no more.'' she stood and listened very attentively, but no tears came into her eyes. 'i'll tell thee everything i can; there's little to relate. i saw an aged aged man, a-sitting on a gate. 'who are you, aged man ' i said, 'and how is it you live ' and his answer trickled through my head like water through a sieve. he said 'i look for butterflies that sleep among the wheat: i make them into mutton-pies, and sell them in the street. i sell them unto men,' he said, 'who sail on stormy seas; and that's the way i get my bread a trifle, if you please.' but i was thinking of a plan to dye one's whiskers green, and always use so large a fan that they could not be seen. so, having no reply to give to what the old man said, i cried, 'come, tell me how you live ' and thumped him on the head. his accents mild took up the tale: he said 'i go my ways, and when i find a mountain-rill, i set it in a blaze; and thence they make a stuff they call rolands' macassar oil yet twopence-halfpenny is all they give me for my toil.' but i was thinking of a way to feed oneself on batter, and so go on from day to day getting a little fatter. i shook him well from side to side, until his face was blue: 'come, tell me how you live,' i cried, 'and what it is you do ' he said 'i hunt for haddocks' eyes among the heather bright, and work them into waistcoat-buttons in the silent night. and these i do not sell for gold or coin of silvery shine but for a copper halfpenny, and that will purchase nine. 'i sometimes dig for buttered rolls, or set limed twigs for crabs; i sometimes search the grassy knolls for wheels of hansom-cabs. and that's the way' (he gave a wink) 'by which i get my wealth and very gladly will i drink your honour's noble health.' i heard him then, for i had just completed my design to keep the menai bridge from rust by boiling it in wine. i thanked him much for telling me the way he got his wealth, but chiefly for his wish that he might drink my noble health. and now, if e'er by chance i put my fingers into glue or madly squeeze a right-hand foot into a left-hand shoe, or if i drop upon my toe a very heavy weight, i weep, for it reminds me so, of that old man i used to know whose look was mild, whose speech was slow, whose hair was whiter than the snow, whose face was very like a crow, with eyes, like cinders, all aglow, who seemed distracted with his woe, who rocked his body to and fro, and muttered mumblingly and low, as if his mouth were full of dough, who snorted like a buffalo that summer evening, long ago, a-sitting on a gate.' as the knight sang the last words of the ballad, he gathered up the reins, and turned his horse's head along the road by which they had come. 'you've only a few yards to go,' he said, 'down the hill and over that little brook, and then you'll be a queen but you'll stay and see me off first ' he added as alice turned with an eager look in the direction to which he pointed. 'i shan't be long. you'll wait and wave your handkerchief when i get to that turn in the road i think it'll encourage me, you see.' 'of course i'll wait,' said alice: 'and thank you very much for coming so far and for the song i liked it very much.' 'i hope so,' the knight said doubtfully: 'but you didn't cry so much as i thought you would.' so they shook hands, and then the knight rode slowly away into the forest. 'it won't take long to see him off, i expect,' alice said to herself, as she stood watching him. 'there he goes right on his head as usual however, he gets on again pretty easily that comes of having so many things hung round the horse ' so she went on talking to herself, as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other. after the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her handkerchief to him, and waited till he was out of sight. 'i hope it encouraged him,' she said, as she turned to run down the hill: 'and now for the last brook, and to be a queen how grand it sounds ' a very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook. 'the eighth square at last ' she cried as she bounded across, and threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss, with little flower-beds dotted about it here and there. 'oh, how glad i am to get here and what is this on my head ' she exclaimed in a tone of dismay, as she put her hands up to something very heavy, and fitted tight all round her head. 'but how can it have got there without my knowing it ' she said to herself, as she lifted it off, and set it on her lap to make out what it could possibly be. it was a golden crown. chapter ix. queen alice 'well, this is grand ' said alice. 'i never expected i should be a queen so soon and i'll tell you what it is, your majesty,' she went on in a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself), 'it'll never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that queens have to be dignified, you know ' so she got up and walked about rather stiffly just at first, as she was afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the thought that there was nobody to see her, 'and if i really am a queen,' she said as she sat down again, 'i shall be able to manage it quite well in time.' everything was happening so oddly that she didn't feel a bit surprised at finding the red queen and the white queen sitting close to her, one on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. however, there would be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. 'please, would you tell me ' she began, looking timidly at the red queen. 'speak when you're spoken to ' the queen sharply interrupted her. 'but if everybody obeyed that rule,' said alice, who was always ready for a little argument, 'and if you only spoke when you were spoken to, and the other person always waited for you to begin, you see nobody would ever say anything, so that ' 'ridiculous ' cried the queen. 'why, don't you see, child ' here she broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenly changed the subject of the conversation. 'what do you mean by 'if you really are a queen' what right have you to call yourself so you can't be a queen, you know, till you've passed the proper examination. and the sooner we begin it, the better.' 'i only said 'if' ' poor alice pleaded in a piteous tone. the two queens looked at each other, and the red queen remarked, with a little shudder, 'she says she only said 'if' ' 'but she said a great deal more than that ' the white queen moaned, wringing her hands. 'oh, ever so much more than that ' 'so you did, you know,' the red queen said to alice. 'always speak the truth think before you speak and write it down afterwards.' 'i'm sure i didn't mean ' alice was beginning, but the red queen interrupted her impatiently. 'that's just what i complain of you should have meant what do you suppose is the use of child without any meaning even a joke should have some meaning and a child's more important than a joke, i hope. you couldn't deny that, even if you tried with both hands.' 'i don't deny things with my hands,' alice objected. 'nobody said you did,' said the red queen. 'i said you couldn't if you tried.' 'she's in that state of mind,' said the white queen, 'that she wants to deny something only she doesn't know what to deny ' 'a nasty, vicious temper,' the red queen remarked; and then there was an uncomfortable silence for a minute or two. the red queen broke the silence by saying to the white queen, 'i invite you to alice's dinner-party this afternoon.' the white queen smiled feebly, and said 'and i invite you.' 'i didn't know i was to have a party at all,' said alice; 'but if there is to be one, i think i ought to invite the guests.' 'we gave you the opportunity of doing it,' the red queen remarked: 'but i daresay you've not had many lessons in manners yet ' 'manners are not taught in lessons,' said alice. 'lessons teach you to do sums, and things of that sort.' 'and you do addition ' the white queen asked. 'what's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one ' 'i don't know,' said alice. 'i lost count.' 'she can't do addition,' the red queen interrupted. 'can you do subtraction take nine from eight.' 'nine from eight i can't, you know,' alice replied very readily: 'but ' 'she can't do subtraction,' said the white queen. 'can you do division divide a loaf by a knife what's the answer to that ' 'i suppose ' alice was beginning, but the red queen answered for her. 'bread-and-butter, of course. try another subtraction sum. take a bone from a dog: what remains ' alice considered. 'the bone wouldn't remain, of course, if i took it and the dog wouldn't remain; it would come to bite me and i'm sure i shouldn't remain ' 'then you think nothing would remain ' said the red queen. 'i think that's the answer.' 'wrong, as usual,' said the red queen: 'the dog's temper would remain.' 'but i don't see how ' 'why, look here ' the red queen cried. 'the dog would lose its temper, wouldn't it ' 'perhaps it would,' alice replied cautiously. 'then if the dog went away, its temper would remain ' the queen exclaimed triumphantly. alice said, as gravely as she could, 'they might go different ways.' but she couldn't help thinking to herself, 'what dreadful nonsense we are talking ' 'she can't do sums a bit ' the queens said together, with great emphasis. 'can you do sums ' alice said, turning suddenly on the white queen, for she didn't like being found fault with so much. the queen gasped and shut her eyes. 'i can do addition, if you give me time but i can't do subtraction, under any circumstances ' 'of course you know your a b c ' said the red queen. 'to be sure i do.' said alice. 'so do i,' the white queen whispered: 'we'll often say it over together, dear. and i'll tell you a secret i can read words of one letter isn't that grand however, don't be discouraged. you'll come to it in time.' here the red queen began again. 'can you answer useful questions ' she said. 'how is bread made ' 'i know that ' alice cried eagerly. 'you take some flour ' 'where do you pick the flower ' the white queen asked. 'in a garden, or in the hedges ' 'well, it isn't picked at all,' alice explained: 'it's ground ' 'how many acres of ground ' said the white queen. 'you mustn't leave out so many things.' 'fan her head ' the red queen anxiously interrupted. 'she'll be feverish after so much thinking.' so they set to work and fanned her with bunches of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew her hair about so. 'she's all right again now,' said the red queen. 'do you know languages what's the french for fiddle-de-dee ' 'fiddle-de-dee's not english,' alice replied gravely. 'who ever said it was ' said the red queen. alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. 'if you'll tell me what language 'fiddle-de-dee' is, i'll tell you the french for it ' she exclaimed triumphantly. but the red queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said 'queens never make bargains.' 'i wish queens never asked questions,' alice thought to herself. 'don't let us quarrel,' the white queen said in an anxious tone. 'what is the cause of lightning ' 'the cause of lightning,' alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite certain about this, 'is the thunder no, no ' she hastily corrected herself. 'i meant the other way.' 'it's too late to correct it,' said the red queen: 'when you've once said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.' 'which reminds me ' the white queen said, looking down and nervously clasping and unclasping her hands, 'we had such a thunderstorm last tuesday i mean one of the last set of tuesdays, you know.' alice was puzzled. 'in our country,' she remarked, 'there's only one day at a time.' the red queen said, 'that's a poor thin way of doing things. now here, we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights together for warmth, you know.' 'are five nights warmer than one night, then ' alice ventured to ask. 'five times as warm, of course.' 'but they should be five times as cold, by the same rule ' 'just so ' cried the red queen. 'five times as warm, and five times as cold just as i'm five times as rich as you are, and five times as clever ' alice sighed and gave it up. 'it's exactly like a riddle with no answer ' she thought. 'humpty dumpty saw it too,' the white queen went on in a low voice, more as if she were talking to herself. 'he came to the door with a corkscrew in his hand ' 'what did he want ' said the red queen. 'he said he would come in,' the white queen went on, 'because he was looking for a hippopotamus. now, as it happened, there wasn't such a thing in the house, that morning.' 'is there generally ' alice asked in an astonished tone. 'well, only on thursdays,' said the queen. 'i know what he came for,' said alice: 'he wanted to punish the fish, because ' here the white queen began again. 'it was such a thunderstorm, you can't think ' ('she never could, you know,' said the red queen.) 'and part of the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in and it went rolling round the room in great lumps and knocking over the tables and things till i was so frightened, i couldn't remember my own name ' alice thought to herself, 'i never should try to remember my name in the middle of an accident where would be the use of it ' but she did not say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor queen's feeling. 'your majesty must excuse her,' the red queen said to alice, taking one of the white queen's hands in her own, and gently stroking it: 'she means well, but she can't help saying foolish things, as a general rule.' the white queen looked timidly at alice, who felt she ought to say something kind, but really couldn't think of anything at the moment. 'she never was really well brought up,' the red queen went on: 'but it's amazing how good-tempered she is pat her on the head, and see how pleased she'll be ' but this was more than alice had courage to do. 'a little kindness and putting her hair in papers would do wonders with her ' the white queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on alice's shoulder. 'i am so sleepy ' she moaned. 'she's tired, poor thing ' said the red queen. 'smooth her hair lend her your nightcap and sing her a soothing lullaby.' 'i haven't got a nightcap with me,' said alice, as she tried to obey the first direction: 'and i don't know any soothing lullabies.' 'i must do it myself, then,' said the red queen, and she began: 'hush-a-by lady, in alice's lap till the feast's ready, we've time for a nap: when the feast's over, we'll go to the ball red queen, and white queen, and alice, and all 'and now you know the words,' she added, as she put her head down on alice's other shoulder, 'just sing it through to me. i'm getting sleepy, too.' in another moment both queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud. 'what am i to do ' exclaimed alice, looking about in great perplexity, as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down from her shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. 'i don't think it ever happened before, that any one had to take care of two queens asleep at once no, not in all the history of england it couldn't, you know, because there never was more than one queen at a time. do wake up, you heavy things ' she went on in an impatient tone; but there was no answer but a gentle snoring. the snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a tune: at last she could even make out the words, and she listened so eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly missed them. she was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words queen alice in large letters, and on each side of the arch there was a bell-handle; one was marked 'visitors' bell,' and the other 'servants' bell.' 'i'll wait till the song's over,' thought alice, 'and then i'll ring the which bell must i ring ' she went on, very much puzzled by the names. 'i'm not a visitor, and i'm not a servant. there ought to be one marked 'queen,' you know ' just then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a long beak put its head out for a moment and said 'no admittance till the week after next ' and shut the door again with a bang. alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards her: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on. 'what is it, now ' the frog said in a deep hoarse whisper. alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody. 'where's the servant whose business it is to answer the door ' she began angrily. 'which door ' said the frog. alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he spoke. 'this door, of course ' the frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute: then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying whether the paint would come off; then he looked at alice. 'to answer the door ' he said. 'what's it been asking of ' he was so hoarse that alice could scarcely hear him. 'i don't know what you mean,' she said. 'i talks english, doesn't i ' the frog went on. 'or are you deaf what did it ask you ' 'nothing ' alice said impatiently. 'i've been knocking at it ' 'shouldn't do that shouldn't do that ' the frog muttered. 'vexes it, you know.' then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his great feet. 'you let it alone,' he panted out, as he hobbled back to his tree, 'and it'll let you alone, you know.' at this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard singing: 'to the looking-glass world it was alice that said, 'i've a sceptre in hand, i've a crown on my head; let the looking-glass creatures, whatever they be, come and dine with the red queen, the white queen, and me.'' and hundreds of voices joined in the chorus: 'then fill up the glasses as quick as you can, and sprinkle the table with buttons and bran: put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea and welcome queen alice with thirty-times-three ' then followed a confused noise of cheering, and alice thought to herself, 'thirty times three makes ninety. i wonder if any one's counting ' in a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill voice sang another verse; ''o looking-glass creatures,' quoth alice, 'draw near 'tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear: 'tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea along with the red queen, the white queen, and me '' then came the chorus again: 'then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink, or anything else that is pleasant to drink: mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine and welcome queen alice with ninety-times-nine ' 'ninety times nine ' alice repeated in despair, 'oh, that'll never be done i'd better go in at once ' and there was a dead silence the moment she appeared. alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large hall, and noticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds: some were animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among them. 'i'm glad they've come without waiting to be asked,' she thought: 'i should never have known who were the right people to invite ' there were three chairs at the head of the table; the red and white queens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty. alice sat down in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing for some one to speak. at last the red queen began. 'you've missed the soup and fish,' she said. 'put on the joint ' and the waiters set a leg of mutton before alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve a joint before. 'you look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton,' said the red queen. 'alice mutton; mutton alice.' the leg of mutton got up in the dish and made a little bow to alice; and alice returned the bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused. 'may i give you a slice ' she said, taking up the knife and fork, and looking from one queen to the other. 'certainly not,' the red queen said, very decidedly: 'it isn't etiquette to cut any one you've been introduced to. remove the joint ' and the waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its place. 'i won't be introduced to the pudding, please,' alice said rather hastily, 'or we shall get no dinner at all. may i give you some ' but the red queen looked sulky, and growled 'pudding alice; alice pudding. remove the pudding ' and the waiters took it away so quickly that alice couldn't return its bow. however, she didn't see why the red queen should be the only one to give orders, so, as an experiment, she called out 'waiter bring back the pudding ' and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. it was so large that she couldn't help feeling a little shy with it, as she had been with the mutton; however, she conquered her shyness by a great effort and cut a slice and handed it to the red queen. 'what impertinence ' said the pudding. 'i wonder how you'd like it, if i were to cut a slice out of you, you creature ' it spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and alice hadn't a word to say in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp. 'make a remark,' said the red queen: 'it's ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the pudding ' 'do you know, i've had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to-day,' alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she opened her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her; 'and it's a very curious thing, i think every poem was about fishes in some way. do you know why they're so fond of fishes, all about here ' she spoke to the red queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark. 'as to fishes,' she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth close to alice's ear, 'her white majesty knows a lovely riddle all in poetry all about fishes. shall she repeat it ' 'her red majesty's very kind to mention it,' the white queen murmured into alice's other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. 'it would be such a treat may i ' 'please do,' alice said very politely. the white queen laughed with delight, and stroked alice's cheek. then she began: ''first, the fish must be caught.' that is easy: a baby, i think, could have caught it. 'next, the fish must be bought.' that is easy: a penny, i think, would have bought it. 'now cook me the fish ' that is easy, and will not take more than a minute. 'let it lie in a dish ' that is easy, because it already is in it. 'bring it here let me sup ' it is easy to set such a dish on the table. 'take the dish-cover up ' ah, that is so hard that i fear i'm unable for it holds it like glue holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle: which is easiest to do, un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle ' 'take a minute to think about it, and then guess,' said the red queen. 'meanwhile, we'll drink your health queen alice's health ' she screamed at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly, and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their faces others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off the edges of the table and three of them (who looked like kangaroos) scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up the gravy, 'just like pigs in a trough ' thought alice. 'you ought to return thanks in a neat speech,' the red queen said, frowning at alice as she spoke. 'we must support you, you know,' the white queen whispered, as alice got up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened. 'thank you very much,' she whispered in reply, 'but i can do quite well without.' 'that wouldn't be at all the thing,' the red queen said very decidedly: so alice tried to submit to it with a good grace. ('and they did push so ' she said afterwards, when she was telling her sister the history of the feast. 'you would have thought they wanted to squeeze me flat ') in fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she made her speech: the two queens pushed her so, one on each side, that they nearly lifted her up into the air: 'i rise to return thanks ' alice began: and she really did rise as she spoke, several inches; but she got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself down again. 'take care of yourself ' screamed the white queen, seizing alice's hair with both her hands. 'something's going to happen ' and then (as alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened in a moment. the candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. as to the bottles, they each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: 'and very like birds they look,' alice thought to herself, as well as she could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning. at this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see what was the matter with the white queen; but, instead of the queen, there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. 'here i am ' cried a voice from the soup tureen, and alice turned again, just in time to see the queen's broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup. there was not a moment to be lost. already several of the guests were lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table towards alice's chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of its way. 'i can't stand this any longer ' she cried as she jumped up and seized the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes, guests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor. 'and as for you,' she went on, turning fiercely upon the red queen, whom she considered as the cause of all the mischief but the queen was no longer at her side she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her. at any other time, alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was far too much excited to be surprised at anything now. 'as for you,' she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, 'i'll shake you into a kitten, that i will ' she took her off the table as she spoke, and shook her backwards and forwards with all her might. the red queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as alice went on shaking her, she kept on growing shorter and fatter and softer and rounder and and it really was a kitten, after all. 'your majesty shouldn't purr so loud,' alice said, rubbing her eyes, and addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity. 'you woke me out of oh such a nice dream and you've been along with me, kitty all through the looking-glass world. did you know it, dear ' it is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (alice had once made the remark) that, whatever you say to them, they always purr. 'if they would only purr for 'yes' and mew for 'no,' or any rule of that sort,' she had said, 'so that one could keep up a conversation but how can you talk with a person if they always say the same thing ' on this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess whether it meant 'yes' or 'no.' so alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the red queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put the kitten and the queen to look at each other. 'now, kitty ' she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly. 'confess that was what you turned into ' ('but it wouldn't look at it,' she said, when she was explaining the thing afterwards to her sister: 'it turned away its head, and pretended not to see it: but it looked a little ashamed of itself, so i think it must have been the red queen.') 'sit up a little more stiffly, dear ' alice cried with a merry laugh. 'and curtsey while you're thinking what to what to purr. it saves time, remember ' and she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, 'just in honour of having been a red queen.' 'snowdrop, my pet ' she went on, looking over her shoulder at the white kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, 'when will dinah have finished with your white majesty, i wonder that must be the reason you were so untidy in my dream dinah do you know that you're scrubbing a white queen really, it's most disrespectful of you 'and what did dinah turn to, i wonder ' she prattled on, as she settled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand, to watch the kittens. 'tell me, dinah, did you turn to humpty dumpty i think you did however, you'd better not mention it to your friends just yet, for i'm not sure. 'by the way, kitty, if only you'd been really with me in my dream, there was one thing you would have enjoyed i had such a quantity of poetry said to me, all about fishes to-morrow morning you shall have a real treat. all the time you're eating your breakfast, i'll repeat 'the walrus and the carpenter' to you; and then you can make believe it's oysters, dear 'now, kitty, let's consider who it was that dreamed it all. this is a serious question, my dear, and you should not go on licking your paw like that as if dinah hadn't washed you this morning you see, kitty, it must have been either me or the red king. he was part of my dream, of course but then i was part of his dream, too was it the red king, kitty you were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know oh, kitty, do help to settle it i'm sure your paw can wait ' but the provoking kitten only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn't heard the question. which do you think it was a boat beneath a sunny sky, lingering onward dreamily in an evening of july children three that nestle near, eager eye and willing ear, pleased a simple tale to hear long has paled that sunny sky: echoes fade and memories die. autumn frosts have slain july. still she haunts me, phantomwise, alice moving under skies never seen by waking eyes. children yet, the tale to hear, eager eye and willing ear, lovingly shall nestle near. in a wonderland they lie, dreaming as the days go by, dreaming as the summers die: ever drifting down the stream lingering in the golden gleam life, what is it but a dream if and the thing is wildly possible the charge of writing nonsense were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem, it would be based, i feel convinced, on the line (in p 'then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes.' in view of this painful possibility, i will not (as i might) appeal indignantly to my other writings as a proof that i am incapable of such a deed: i will not (as i might) point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it, or to its noble teachings in natural history i will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened. the bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished, and it more than once happened, when the time came for replacing it, that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to. they knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the bellman about it he would only refer to his naval code, and read out in pathetic tones admiralty instructions which none of them had ever been able to understand so it generally ended in its being fastened on, anyhow, across the rudder. the helmsman used to stand by with tears in his eyes; he knew it was all wrong, but alas ruleof the code, 'no one shall speak to the man at the helm,' had been completed by the bellman himself with the words 'and the man at the helm shall speak to no one.' so remonstrance was impossible, and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day. during these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards. as this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the jabberwock, let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me, how to pronounce 'slithy toves.' the 'i' in 'slithy' is long, as in 'writhe'; and 'toves' is pronounced so as to rhyme with 'groves.' again, the first 'o' in 'borogoves' is pronounced like the 'o' in 'borrow.' i have heard people try to give it the sound of the 'o' in 'worry'. such is human perversity. this also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in that poem. humpty-dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all. for instance, take the two words 'fuming' and 'furious.' make up your mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will first. now open your mouth and speak. if your thoughts incline ever so little towards 'fuming,' you will say 'fuming-furious;' if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards 'furious,' you will say 'furious-fuming;' but if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say 'frumious.' supposing that, when pistol uttered the well-known words 'under which king, bezonian speak or die ' justice shallow had felt certain that it was either william or richard, but had not been able to settle which, so that he could not possibly say either name before the other, can it be doubted that, rather than die, he would have gasped out 'rilchiam ' fit the first the landing 'just the place for a snark ' the bellman cried, as he landed his crew with care; supporting each man on the top of the tide by a finger entwined in his hair. 'just the place for a snark i have said it twice: that alone should encourage the crew. just the place for a snark i have said it thrice: what i tell you three times is true.' the crew was complete: it included a boots a maker of bonnets and hoods a barrister, brought to arrange their disputes and a broker, to value their goods. a billiard-marker, whose skill was immense, might perhaps have won more than his share but a banker, engaged at enormous expense, had the whole of their cash in his care. there was also a beaver, that paced on the deck, or would sit making lace in the bow: and had often (the bellman said) saved them from wreck, though none of the sailors knew how. there was one who was famed for the number of things he forgot when he entered the ship: his umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings, and the clothes he had bought for the trip. he had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed, with his name painted clearly on each: but, since he omitted to mention the fact, they were all left behind on the beach. the loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because he had seven coats on when he came, with three pairs of boots but the worst of it was, he had wholly forgotten his name. he would answer to 'hi ' or to any loud cry, such as 'fry me ' or 'fritter my wig ' to 'what-you-may-call-um ' or 'what-was-his-name ' but especially 'thing-um-a-jig ' while, for those who preferred a more forcible word, he had different names from these: his intimate friends called him 'candle-ends,' and his enemies 'toasted-cheese.' 'his form is ungainly his intellect small ' (so the bellman would often remark) 'but his courage is perfect and that, after all, is the thing that one needs with a snark.' he would joke with hyenas, returning their stare with an impudent wag of the head: and he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear, 'just to keep up its spirits,' he said. he came as a baker: but owned, when too late and it drove the poor bellman half-mad he could only bake bridecake for which, i may state, no materials were to be had. the last of the crew needs especial remark, though he looked an incredible dunce: he had just one idea but, that one being 'snark,' the good bellman engaged him at once. he came as a butcher: but gravely declared, when the ship had been sailing a week, he could only kill beavers. the bellman looked scared, and was almost too frightened to speak: but at length he explained, in a tremulous tone, there was only one beaver on board; and that was a tame one he had of his own, whose death would be deeply deplored. the beaver, who happened to hear the remark, protested, with tears in its eyes, that not even the rapture of hunting the snark could atone for that dismal surprise it strongly advised that the butcher should be conveyed in a separate ship: but the bellman declared that would never agree with the plans he had made for the trip: navigation was always a difficult art, though with only one ship and one bell: and he feared he must really decline, for his part, undertaking another as well. the beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure a second-hand dagger-proof coat so the baker advised it and next, to insure its life in some office of note: this the banker suggested, and offered for hire (on moderate terms), or for sale, two excellent policies, one against fire, and one against damage from hail. yet still, ever after that sorrowful day, whenever the butcher was by, the beaver kept looking the opposite way, and appeared unaccountably shy. fit the second the bellman's speech the bellman himself they all praised to the skies such a carriage, such ease and such grace such solemnity, too one could see he was wise, the moment one looked in his face he had bought a large map representing the sea, without the least vestige of land: and the crew were much pleased when they found it to be a map they could all understand. 'what's the good of mercator's north poles and equators, tropics, zones, and meridian lines ' so the bellman would cry: and the crew would reply 'they are merely conventional signs 'other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes but we've got our brave captain to thank:' (so the crew would protest) 'that he's bought us the best a perfect and absolute blank ' this was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out that the captain they trusted so well had only one notion for crossing the ocean, and that was to tingle his bell. he was thoughtful and grave but the orders he gave were enough to bewilder a crew. when he cried 'steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard ' what on earth was the helmsman to do then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes: a thing, as the bellman remarked, that frequently happens in tropical climes, when a vessel is, so to speak, 'snarked.' but the principal failing occurred in the sailing, and the bellman, perplexed and distressed, said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due east, that the ship would not travel due west but the danger was past they had landed at last, with their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags: yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view, which consisted of chasms and crags. the bellman perceived that their spirits were low, and repeated in musical tone some jokes he had kept for a season of woe but the crew would do nothing but groan. he served out some grog with a liberal hand, and bade them sit down on the beach: and they could not but own that their captain looked grand, as he stood and delivered his speech. 'friends, romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears ' (they were all of them fond of quotations: so they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers, while he served out additional rations). 'we have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks, (four weeks to the month you may mark), but never as yet 'tis your captain who speaks) have we caught the least glimpse of a snark 'we have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days, (seven days to the week i allow), but a snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze, we have never beheld till now 'come, listen, my men, while i tell you again the five unmistakable marks by which you may know, wheresoever you go, the warranted genuine snarks. 'let us take them in order. the first is the taste, which is meagre and hollow, but crisp: like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist, with a flavour of will-o'-the-wisp. 'its habit of getting up late you'll agree that it carries too far, when i say that it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea, and dines on the following day. 'the third is its slowness in taking a jest. should you happen to venture on one, it will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed: and it always looks grave at a pun. 'the fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines, which is constantly carries about, and believes that they add to the beauty of scenes a sentiment open to doubt. 'the fifth is ambition. it next will be right to describe each particular batch: distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite, and those that have whiskers, and scratch. 'for, although common snarks do no manner of harm, yet, i feel it my duty to say, some are boojums ' the bellman broke off in alarm, for the baker had fainted away. fit the third the baker's tale they roused him with muffins they roused him with ice they roused him with mustard and cress they roused him with jam and judicious advice they set him conundrums to guess. when at length he sat up and was able to speak, his sad story he offered to tell; and the bellman cried 'silence not even a shriek ' and excitedly tingled his bell. there was silence supreme not a shriek, not a scream, scarcely even a howl or a groan, as the man they called 'ho ' told his story of woe in an antediluvian tone. 'my father and mother were honest, though poor ' 'skip all that ' cried the bellman in haste. 'if it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a snark we have hardly a minute to waste ' 'i skip forty years,' said the baker, in tears, 'and proceed without further remark to the day when you took me aboard of your ship to help you in hunting the snark. 'a dear uncle of mine (after whom i was named) remarked, when i bade him farewell ' 'oh, skip your dear uncle ' the bellman exclaimed, as he angrily tingled his bell. 'he remarked to me then,' said that mildest of men, ''if your snark be a snark, that is right: fetch it home by all means you may serve it with greens, and it's handy for striking a light. ''you may seek it with thimbles and seek it with care; you may hunt it with forks and hope; you may threaten its life with a railway-share; you may charm it with smiles and soap '' ('that's exactly the method,' the bellman bold in a hasty parenthesis cried, 'that's exactly the way i have always been told that the capture of snarks should be tried ') ''but oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day, if your snark be a boojum for then you will softly and suddenly vanish away, and never be met with again ' 'it is this, it is this that oppresses my soul, when i think of my uncle's last words: and my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl brimming over with quivering curds 'it is this, it is this ' 'we have had that before ' the bellman indignantly said. and the baker replied 'let me say it once more. it is this, it is this that i dread 'i engage with the snark every night after dark in a dreamy delirious fight: i serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes, and i use it for striking a light: 'but if ever i meet with a boojum, that day, in a moment (of this i am sure), i shall softly and suddenly vanish away and the notion i cannot endure ' fit the fourth the hunting the bellman looked huffish, and wrinkled his brow. 'if only you'd spoken before it's excessively awkward to mention it now, with the snark, so to speak, at the door 'we should all of us grieve, as you well may believe, if you never were met with again but surely, my man, when the voyage began, you might have suggested it then 'it's excessively awkward to mention it now as i think i've already remarked.' and the man they called 'hi ' replied, with a sigh, 'i informed you the day we embarked. 'you may charge me with murder or want of sense (we are all of us weak at times): but the slightest approach to a false pretence was never among my crimes 'i said it in hebrew i said it in dutch i said it in german and greek: but i wholly forgot (and it vexes me much) that english is what you speak ' ''tis a pitiful tale,' said the bellman, whose face had grown longer at every word: 'but, now that you've stated the whole of your case, more debate would be simply absurd. 'the rest of my speech' (he explained to his men) 'you shall hear when i've leisure to speak it. but the snark is at hand, let me tell you again 'tis your glorious duty to seek it 'to seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care; to pursue it with forks and hope; to threaten its life with a railway-share; to charm it with smiles and soap 'for the snark's a peculiar creature, that won't be caught in a commonplace way. do all that you know, and try all that you don't: not a chance must be wasted to-day 'for england expects i forbear to proceed: 'tis a maxim tremendous, but trite: and you'd best be unpacking the things that you need to rig yourselves out for the fight.' then the banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed), and changed his loose silver for notes. the baker with care combed his whiskers and hair, and shook the dust out of his coats. the boots and the broker were sharpening a spade each working the grindstone in turn: but the beaver went on making lace, and displayed no interest in the concern: though the barrister tried to appeal to its pride, and vainly proceeded to cite a number of cases, in which making laces had been proved an infringement of right. the maker of bonnets ferociously planned a novel arrangement of bows: while the billiard-marker with quivering hand was chalking the tip of his nose. but the butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine, with yellow kid gloves and a ruff said he felt it exactly like going to dine, which the bellman declared was all 'stuff.' 'introduce me, now there's a good fellow,' he said, 'if we happen to meet it together ' and the bellman, sagaciously nodding his head, said 'that must depend on the weather.' the beaver went simply galumphing about, at seeing the butcher so shy: and even the baker, though stupid and stout, made an effort to wink with one eye. 'be a man ' said the bellman in wrath, as he heard the butcher beginning to sob. 'should we meet with a jubjub, that desperate bird, we shall need all our strength for the job ' fit the fifth the beaver's lesson they sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; they pursued it with forks and hope; they threatened its life with a railway-share; they charmed it with smiles and soap. then the butcher contrived an ingenious plan for making a separate sally; and had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man, a dismal and desolate valley. but the very same plan to the beaver occurred: it had chosen the very same place: yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word, the disgust that appeared in his face. each thought he was thinking of nothing but 'snark' and the glorious work of the day; and each tried to pretend that he did not remark that the other was going that way. but the valley grew narrow and narrower still, and the evening got darker and colder, till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill) they marched along shoulder to shoulder. then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky, and they knew that some danger was near: the beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail, and even the butcher felt queer. he thought of his childhood, left far far behind that blissful and innocent state the sound so exactly recalled to his mind a pencil that squeaks on a slate ''tis the voice of the jubjub ' he suddenly cried. (this man, that they used to call 'dunce.') 'as the bellman would tell you,' he added with pride, 'i have uttered that sentiment once. ''tis the note of the jubjub keep count, i entreat; you will find i have told it you twice. 'tis the song of the jubjub the proof is complete, if only i've stated it thrice.' the beaver had counted with scrupulous care, attending to every word: but it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair, when the third repetition occurred. it felt that, in spite of all possible pains, it had somehow contrived to lose count, and the only thing now was to rack its poor brains by reckoning up the amount. 'two added to one if that could but be done,' it said, 'with one's fingers and thumbs ' recollecting with tears how, in earlier years, it had taken no pains with its sums. 'the thing can be done,' said the butcher, 'i think. the thing must be done, i am sure. the thing shall be done bring me paper and ink, the best there is time to procure.' the beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens, and ink in unfailing supplies: while strange creepy creatures came out of their dens, and watched them with wondering eyes. so engrossed was the butcher, he heeded them not, as he wrote with a pen in each hand, and explained all the while in a popular style which the beaver could well understand. 'taking three as the subject to reason about a convenient number to state we add seven, and ten, and then multiply out by one thousand diminished by eight. 'the result we proceed to divide, as you see, by nine hundred and ninety two: then subtract seventeen, and the answer must be exactly and perfectly true. 'the method employed i would gladly explain, while i have it so clear in my head, if i had but the time and you had but the brain but much yet remains to be said. 'in one moment i've seen what has hitherto been enveloped in absolute mystery, and without extra charge i will give you at large a lesson in natural history.' in his genial way he proceeded to say (forgetting all laws of propriety, and that giving instruction, without introduction, would have caused quite a thrill in society), 'as to temper the jubjub's a desperate bird, since it lives in perpetual passion: its taste in costume is entirely absurd it is ages ahead of the fashion: 'but it knows any friend it has met once before: it never will look at a bribe: and in charity-meetings it stands at the door, and collects though it does not subscribe. 'its' flavour when cooked is more exquisite far than mutton, or oysters, or eggs: (some think it keeps best in an ivory jar, and some, in mahogany kegs:) 'you boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue: you condense it with locusts and tape: still keeping one principal object in view to preserve its symmetrical shape.' the butcher would gladly have talked till next day, but he felt that the lesson must end, and he wept with delight in attempting to say he considered the beaver his friend. while the beaver confessed, with affectionate looks more eloquent even than tears, it had learned in ten minutes far more than all books would have taught it in seventy years. they returned hand-in-hand, and the bellman, unmanned (for a moment) with noble emotion, said 'this amply repays all the wearisome days we have spent on the billowy ocean ' such friends, as the beaver and butcher became, have seldom if ever been known; in winter or summer, 'twas always the same you could never meet either alone. and when quarrels arose as one frequently finds quarrels will, spite of every endeavour the song of the jubjub recurred to their minds, and cemented their friendship for ever fit the sixth the barrister's dream they sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; they pursued it with forks and hope; they threatened its life with a railway-share; they charmed it with smiles and soap. but the barrister, weary of proving in vain that the beaver's lace-making was wrong, fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain that his fancy had dwelt on so long. he dreamed that he stood in a shadowy court, where the snark, with a glass in its eye, dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig on the charge of deserting its sty. the witnesses proved, without error or flaw, that the sty was deserted when found: and the judge kept explaining the state of the law in a soft under-current of sound. the indictment had never been clearly expressed, and it seemed that the snark had begun, and had spoken three hours, before any one guessed what the pig was supposed to have done. the jury had each formed a different view (long before the indictment was read), and they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew one word that the others had said. 'you must know ' said the judge: but the snark exclaimed 'fudge ' that statute is obsolete quite let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends on an ancient manorial right. 'in the matter of treason the pig would appear to have aided, but scarcely abetted: while the charge of insolvency fails, it is clear, if you grant the plea 'never indebted.' 'the fact of desertion i will not dispute; but its guilt, as i trust, is removed (so far as related to the costs of this suit) by the alibi which has been proved. 'my poor client's fate now depends on your votes.' here the speaker sat down in his place, and directed the judge to refer to his notes and briefly to sum up the case. but the judge said he never had summed up before; so the snark undertook it instead, and summed it so well that it came to far more than the witnesses ever had said when the verdict was called for, the jury declined, as the word was so puzzling to spell; but they ventured to hope that the snark wouldn't mind undertaking that duty as well. so the snark found the verdict, although, as it owned, it was spent with the toils of the day: when it said the word 'guilty ' the jury all groaned, and some of them fainted away. then the snark pronounced sentence, the judge being quite too nervous to utter a word: when it rose to its feet, there was silence like night, and the fall of a pin might be heard. 'transportation for life' was the sentence it gave, 'and then to be fined forty pound.' the jury all cheered, though the judge said he feared that the phrase was not legally sound. but their wild exultation was suddenly checked when the jailer informed them, with tears, such a sentence would have not the slightest effect, as the pig had been dead for some years. the judge left the court, looking deeply disgusted: but the snark, though a little aghast, as the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted, went bellowing on to the last. thus the barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed to grow every moment more clear: till he woke to the knell of a furious bell, which the bellman rang close at his ear. fit the seventh the banker's fate they sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; they pursued it with forks and hope; they threatened its life with a railway-share; they charmed it with smiles and soap. and the banker, inspired with a courage so new it was matter for general remark, rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view in his zeal to discover the snark but while he was seeking with thimbles and care, a bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh and grabbed at the banker, who shrieked in despair, for he knew it was useless to fly. he offered large discount he offered a cheque (drawn 'to bearer') for seven-pounds-ten: but the bandersnatch merely extended its neck and grabbed at the banker again. without rest or pause while those frumious jaws went savagely snapping around he skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped, till fainting he fell to the ground. the bandersnatch fled as the others appeared led on by that fear-stricken yell: and the bellman remarked 'it is just as i feared ' and solemnly tolled on his bell. he was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace the least likeness to what he had been: while so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white a wonderful thing to be seen to the horror of all who were present that day. he uprose in full evening dress, and with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say what his tongue could no longer express. down he sank in a chair ran his hands through his hair and chanted in mimsiest tones words whose utter inanity proved his insanity, while he rattled a couple of bones. 'leave him here to his fate it is getting so late ' the bellman exclaimed in a fright. 'we have lost half the day. any further delay, and we sha'nt catch a snark before night ' fit the eighth the vanishing they sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; they pursued it with forks and hope; they threatened its life with a railway-share; they charmed it with smiles and soap. they shuddered to think that the chase might fail, and the beaver, excited at last, went bounding along on the tip of its tail, for the daylight was nearly past. 'there is thingumbob shouting ' the bellman said, 'he is shouting like mad, only hark he is waving his hands, he is wagging his head, he has certainly found a snark ' they gazed in delight, while the butcher exclaimed 'he was always a desperate wag ' they beheld him their baker their hero unnamed on the top of a neighboring crag. erect and sublime, for one moment of time. in the next, that wild figure they saw (as if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm, while they waited and listened in awe. 'it's a snark ' was the sound that first came to their ears, and seemed almost too good to be true. then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers: then the ominous words 'it's a boo-' then, silence. some fancied they heard in the air a weary and wandering sigh then sounded like '-jum ' but the others declare it was only a breeze that went by. they hunted till darkness came on, but they found not a button, or feather, or mark, by which they could tell that they stood on the ground where the baker had met with the snark. in the midst of the word he was trying to say, in the midst of his laughter and glee, he had softly and suddenly vanished away - for the snark was a boojum, you see. the ruddy glow of sunset was already fading into the sombre shadows of night, when two travellers might have been observed swiftly at a pace of six miles in the hour descending the rugged side of a mountain; the younger bounding from crag to crag with the agility of a fawn, while his companion, whose aged limbs seemed ill at ease in the heavy chain armour habitually worn by tourists in that district, toiled on painfully at his side. as is always the case under such circumstances, the younger knight was the first to break the silence. a goodly pace, i trow he exclaimed. we sped not thus in the ascent goodly, indeed the other echoed with a groan. we clomb it but at three miles in the hour. and on the dead level our pace is the younger suggested; for he was weak in statistics, and left all such details to his aged companion. four miles in the hour, the other wearily replied. not an ounce more, he added, with that love of metaphor so common in old age, and not a farthing less 'twas three hours past high noon when we left our hostelry, the young man said, musingly. we shall scarce be back by supper-time. perchance mine host will roundly deny us all food he will chide our tardy return, was the grave reply, and such a rebuke will be meet. a brave conceit cried the other, with a merry laugh. and should we bid him bring us yet another course, i trow his answer will be tart we shall but get our deserts, sighed the elder knight, who had never seen a joke in his life, and was somewhat displeased at his companion's untimely levity. 'twill be nine of the clock, he added in an undertone, by the time we regain our hostelry. full many a mile shall we have plodded this day how many how many cried the eager youth, ever athirst for knowledge. the old man was silent. tell me, he answered, after a moment's thought, what time it was when we stood together on yonder peak. not exact to the minute he added hastily, reading a protest in the young man's face. an' thy guess be within one poor half-hour of the mark, 'tis all i ask of thy mother's son then will i tell thee, true to the last inch, how far we shall have trudged betwixt three and nine of the clock. a groan was the young man's only reply; while his convulsed features and the deep wrinkles that chased each other across his manly brow, revealed the abyss of arithmetical agony into which one chance question had plunged him. straight down the crooked lane, and all round the square. let's ask balbus about it, said hugh. all right, said lambert. he can guess it, said hugh. rather, said lambert. no more words were needed: the two brothers understood each other perfectly. balbus was waiting for them at the hotel: the journey down had tired him, he said: so his two pupils had been the round of the place, in search of lodgings, without the old tutor who had been their inseparable companion from their childhood. they had named him after the hero of their latin exercise-book, which overflowed with anecdotes of that versatile genius anecdotes whose vagueness in detail was more than compensated by their sensational brilliance. balbus has overcome all his enemies had been marked by their tutor, in the margin of the book, successful bravery. in this way he had tried to extract a moral from every anecdote about balbus sometimes one of warning, as in balbus had borrowed a healthy dragon, against which he had written rashness in speculation sometimes of encouragement, as in the words influence of sympathy in united action, which stood opposite to the anecdote balbus was assisting his mother-in-law to convince the dragon and sometimes it dwindled down to a single word, such as prudence, which was all he could extract from the touching record that balbus, having scorched the tail of the dragon, went away. his pupils liked the short morals best, as it left them more room for marginal illustrations, and in this instance they required all the space they could get to exhibit the rapidity of the hero's departure. their report of the state of things was discouraging. that most fashionable of watering-places, little mendip, was chockfull (as the boys expressed it) from end to end. but in one square they had seen no less than four cards, in different houses, all announcing in flaming capitals eligible apartments. so there's plenty of choice, after all, you see, said spokesman hugh in conclusion. that doesn't follow from the data, said balbus, as he rose from the easy chair, where he had been dozing over the little mendip gazette . they may be all single rooms. however, we may as well see them. i shall be glad to stretch my legs a bit. an unprejudiced bystander might have objected that the operation was needless, and that this long, lank creature would have been all the better with even shorter legs: but no such thought occurred to his loving pupils. one on each side, they did their best to keep up with his gigantic strides, while hugh repeated the sentence in their father's letter, just received from abroad, over which he and lambert had been puzzling. he says a friend of his, the governor of what was that name again, lambert (kgovjni, said lambert.) well, yes. the governor of what-you-may-call-it wants to give a very small dinner-party, and he means to ask his father's brother-in-law, his brother's father-in-law, his father-in-law's brother, and his brother-in-law's father: and we're to guess how many guests there will be. there was an anxious pause. how large did he say the pudding was to be balbus said at last. take its cubical contents, divide by the cubical contents of what each man can eat, and the quotient he didn't say anything about pudding, said hugh, and here's the square, as they turned a corner and came into sight of the eligible apartments. it is a square was balbus' first cry of delight, as he gazed around him. beautiful beau-ti-ful equilateral and rectangular the boys looked round with less enthusiasm. number nine is the first with a card, said prosaic lambert; but balbus would not so soon awake from his dream of beauty. see, boys he cried. twenty doors on a side what symmetry each side divided into twenty-one equal parts it's delicious shall i knock, or ring said hugh, looking in some perplexity at a square brass plate which bore the simple inscription ring also. both, said balbus. that's an ellipsis, my boy. did you never see an ellipsis before i couldn't hardly read it, said hugh, evasively. it's no good having an ellipsis, if they don't keep it clean. which there is one room, gentlemen, said the smiling landlady. and a sweet room too as snug a little back-room we will see it, said balbus gloomily, as they followed her in. i knew how it would be one room in each house no view, i suppose which indeed there is , gentlemen the landlady indignantly protested, as she drew up the blind, and indicated the back garden. cabbages, i perceive, said balbus. well, they're green, at any rate. which the greens at the shops, their hostess explained, are by no means dependable upon. here you has them on the premises, and of the best. does the window open was always balbus' first question in testing a lodging: and does the chimney smoke his second. satisfied on all points, he secured the refusal of the room, and they moved on to number twenty-five. this landlady was grave and stern. i've nobbut one room left, she told them: and it gives on the back-gyardin. but there are cabbages balbus suggested. the landlady visibly relented. there is, sir, she said: and good ones, though i say it as shouldn't. we can't rely on the shops for greens. so we grows them ourselves. a singular advantage, said balbus: and, after the usual questions, they went on to fifty-two. and i'd gladly accommodate you all, if i could, was the greeting that met them. we are but mortal, (irrelevant muttered balbus) and i've let all my rooms but one. which one is a back-room, i perceive, said balbus: and looking out on on cabbages, i presume yes, indeed, sir said their hostess. whatever other folks may do, we grows our own. for the shops an excellent arrangement balbus interrupted. then one can really depend on their being good. does the window open the usual questions were answered satisfactorily: but this time hugh added one of his own invention does the cat scratch the landlady looked round suspiciously, as if to make sure the cat was not listening, i will not deceive you, gentlemen, she said. it do scratch, but not without you pulls its whiskers it'll never do it, she repeated slowly, with a visible effort to recall the exact words of some written agreement between herself and the cat, without you pulls its whiskers much may be excused in a cat so treated, said balbus, as they left the house and crossed to number seventy-three, leaving the landlady curtseying on the doorstep, and still murmuring to herself her parting words, as if they were a form of blessing, not without you pulls its whiskers at number seventy-three they found only a small shy girl to show the house, who said yes'm in answer to all questions. the usual room, said balbus, as they marched in: the usual back-garden, the usual cabbages. i suppose you can't get them good at the shops yes'm, said the girl. well, you may tell your mistress we will take the room, and that her plan of growing her own cabbages is simply admirable yes'm, said the girl, as she showed them out. one day-room and three bed-rooms, said balbus, as they returned to the hotel. we will take as our day-room the one that gives us the least walking to do to get to it. must we walk from door to door, and count the steps said lambert. no, no figure it out, my boys, figure it out balbus gaily exclaimed, as he put pens, ink, and paper before his hapless pupils, and left the room. i say it'll be a job said hugh. rather said lambert. well, they call me so because i am a little mad, i suppose, she said, good-humouredly, in answer to clara's cautiously-worded question as to how she came by so strange a nick-name. you see, i never do what sane people are expected to do now-a-days. i never wear long trains, (talking of trains, that's the charing cross metropolitan station i've something to tell you about that ), and i never play lawn-tennis. i can't cook an omelette. i can't even set a broken limb there's an ignoramus for you clara was her niece, and full twenty years her junior; in fact, she was still attending a high school an institution of which mad mathesis spoke with undisguised aversion. let a woman be meek and lowly she would say. none of your high schools for me but it was vacation-time just now, and clara was her guest, and mad mathesis was showing her the sights of that eighth wonder of the world london. the charing cross metropolitan station she resumed, waving her hand towards the entrance as if she were introducing her niece to a friend. the bayswater and birmingham extension is just completed, and the trains now run round and round continuously skirting the border of wales, just touching at york, and so round by the east coast back to london. the way the trains run is most peculiar. the westerly ones go round in two hours; the easterly ones take three; but they always manage to start two trains from here, opposite ways, punctually every quarter-of-an-hour. they part to meet again, said clara, her eyes filling with tears at the romantic thought. no need to cry about it her aunt grimly remarked. they don't meet on the same line of rails, you know. talking of meeting, an idea strikes me she added, changing the subject with her usual abruptness. let's go opposite ways round, and see which can meet most trains. no need for a chaperon ladies' saloon, you know. you shall go whichever way you like, and we'll have a bet about it i never make bets, clara said very gravely. our excellent preceptress has often warned us you'd be none the worse if you did mad mathesis interrupted. in fact, you'd be the better, i'm certain neither does our excellent preceptress approve of puns, said clara. but we'll have a match, if you like. let me choose my train, she added after a brief mental calculation, and i'll engage to meet exactly half as many again as you do. not if you count fair, mad mathesis bluntly interrupted. remember, we only count the trains we meet on the way . you mustn't count the one that starts as you start, nor the one that arrives as you arrive. that will only make the difference of one train, said clara, as they turned and entered the station. but i never travelled alone before. there'll be no one to help me to alight. however, i don't mind. let's have a match. a ragged little boy overheard her remark, and came running after her. buy a box of cigar-lights, miss he pleaded, pulling her shawl to attract her attention. clara stopped to explain. i never smoke cigars, she said in a meekly apologetic tone. our excellent preceptress , but mad mathesis impatiently hurried her on, and the little boy was left gazing after her with round eyes of amazement. the two ladies bought their tickets and moved slowly down the central platform, mad mathesis prattling on as usual clara silent, anxiously reconsidering the calculation on which she rested her hopes of winning the match. mind where you go, dear cried her aunt, checking her just in time. one step more, and you'd have been in that pail of cold water i know, i know, clara said, dreamily. the pale, the cold, and the moony take your places on the spring-boards shouted a porter. what are they for clara asked in a terrified whisper. merely to help us into the trains. the elder lady spoke with the nonchalance of one quite used to the process. very few people can get into a carriage without help in less than three seconds, and the trains only stop for one second. at this moment the whistle was heard, and two trains rushed into the station. a moment's pause, and they were gone again; but in that brief interval several hundred passengers had been shot into them, each flying straight to his place with the accuracy of a minie bullet while an equal number were showered out upon the side-platforms. three hours had passed away, and the two friends met again on the charing cross platform, and eagerly compared notes. then clara turned away with a sigh. to young impulsive hearts, like hers, disappointment is always a bitter pill. mad mathesis followed her, full of kindly sympathy. try again, my love she said, cheerily. let us vary the experiment. we will start as we did before, but not to begin counting till our trains meet. when we see each other, we will say 'one ' and so count on till we come here again. clara brightened up. i shall win that , she exclaimed eagerly, if i may choose my train another shriek of engine whistles, another upheaving of spring-boards, another living avalanche plunging into two trains as they flashed by: and the travellers were off again. each gazed eagerly from her carriage window, holding up her handkerchief as a signal to her friend. a rush and a roar. two trains shot past each other in a tunnel, and two travellers leaned back in their corners with a sigh or rather with two sighs of relief. one clara murmured to herself. won it's a word of good omen. this time, at any rate, the victory will be mine but was it noonday on the open sea within a few degrees of the equator is apt to be oppressively warm; and our two travellers were now airily clad in suits of dazzling white linen, having laid aside the chain-armour which they had found not only endurable in the cold mountain air they had lately been breathing, but a necessary precaution against the daggers of the banditti who infested the heights. their holiday-trip was over, and they were now on their way home, in the monthly packet which plied between the two great ports of the island they had been exploring. along with their armour, the tourists had laid aside the antiquated speech it had pleased them to affect while in knightly disguise, and had returned to the ordinary style of two country gentlemen of the twentieth century. stretched on a pile of cushions, under the shade of a huge umbrella, they were lazily watching some native fishermen, who had come on board at the last landing-place, each carrying over his shoulder a small but heavy sack. a large weighing-machine, that had been used for cargo at the last port, stood on the deck; and round this the fishermen had gathered, and, with much unintelligible jabber, seemed to be weighing their sacks. more like sparrows in a tree than human talk, isn't it the elder tourist remarked to his son, who smiled feebly, but would not exert himself so far as to speak. the old man tried another listener. what have they got in those sacks, captain he inquired, as that great being passed them in his never ending parade to and fro on the deck. the captain paused in his march, and towered over the travellers tall, grave, and serenely self-satisfied. fishermen, he explained, are often passengers in my ship. these five are from mhruxi the place we last touched at and that's the way they carry their money. the money of this island is heavy, gentlemen, but it costs little, as you may guess. we buy it from them by weight about five shillings a pound. i fancy a ten pound-note would buy all those sacks. by this time the old man had closed his eyes in order, no doubt, to concentrate his thoughts on these interesting facts; but the captain failed to realise his motive, and with a grunt resumed his monotonous march. meanwhile the fishermen were getting so noisy over the weighing-machine that one of the sailors took the precaution of carrying off all the weights, leaving them to amuse themselves with such substitutes in the form of winch-handles, belaying-pins, etc., as they could find. this brought their excitement to a speedy end: they carefully hid their sacks in the folds of the jib that lay on the deck near the tourists, and strolled away. when next the captain's heavy footfall passed, the younger man roused himself to speak. what did you call the place those fellows came from, captain he asked. mhruxi, sir. and the one we are bound for the captain took a long breath, plunged into the word, and came out of it nobly. they call it kgovjni, sir. k i give it up the young man faintly said. he stretched out his hand for a glass of iced water which the compassionate steward had brought him a minute ago, and had set down, unluckily, just outside the shadow of the umbrella. it was scalding hot, and he decided not to drink it. the effort of making this resolution, coming close on the fatiguing conversation he had just gone through, was too much for him: he sank back among the cushions in silence. his father courteously tried to make amends for his nonchalance . whereabouts are we now, captain said he, have you any idea the captain cast a pitying look on the ignorant landsman. i could tell you that , sir, he said, in a tone of lofty condescension, to an inch you don't say so the old man remarked, in a tone of languid surprise. and mean so, persisted the captain. why, what do you suppose would become of my ship, if i were to lose my longitude and my latitude could you make anything of my dead reckoning nobody could, i'm sure the other heartily rejoined. but he had overdone it. it's perfectly intelligible, the captain said, in an offended tone, to any one that understands such things. with these words he moved away, and began giving orders to the men, who were preparing to hoist the jib. our tourists watched the operation with such interest that neither of them remembered the five money-bags, which in another moment, as the wind filled out the jib, were whirled overboard and fell heavily into the sea. but the poor fishermen had not so easily forgotten their property. in a moment they had rushed to the spot, and stood uttering cries of fury, and pointing, now to the sea, and now to the sailors who had caused the disaster. the old man explained it to the captain. let us make it up among us, he added in conclusion. ten pounds will do it, i think you said but the captain put aside the suggestion with a wave of the hand. no, sir he said, in his grandest manner. you will excuse me, i am sure; but these are my passengers. the accident has happened on board my ship, and under my orders. it is for me to make compensation. he turned to the angry fishermen. come here, my men he said, in the mhruxian dialect. tell me the weight of each sack. i saw you weighing them just now. then ensued a perfect babel of noise, as the five natives explained, all screaming together, how the sailors had carried off the weights, and they had done what they could with whatever came handy. two iron belaying-pins, three blocks, six holystones, four winch-handles, and a large hammer, were now carefully weighed, the captain superintending and noting the results. but the matter did not seem to be settled, even then: an angry discussion followed, in which the sailors and the five natives all joined: and at last the captain approached our tourists with a disconcerted look, which he tried to conceal under a laugh. it's an absurd difficulty, he said. perhaps one of you gentlemen can suggest something. it seems they weighed the sacks two at a time if they didn't have five separate weighings, of course you can't value them separately, the youth hastily decided. let's hear all about it, was the old man's more cautious remark. they did have five separate weighings, the captain said, but well, it beats me entirely he added, in a sudden burst of candour. here's the result. first and second sack weighed twelve pounds; second and third, thirteen and a half; third and fourth, eleven and a half; fourth and fifth, eight: and then they say they had only the large hammer left, and it took three sacks to weigh it down that's the first, third and fifth and they weighed sixteen pounds. there, gentlemen did you ever hear anything like that the old man muttered under his breath if only my sister were here and looked helplessly at his son. his son looked at the five natives. the five natives looked at the captain. the captain looked at nobody: his eyes were cast down, and he seemed to be saying softly to himself contemplate one another, gentlemen, if such be your good pleasure. i contemplate myself and what made you choose the first train, goosey said mad mathesis, as they got into the cab. couldn't you count better than that i took an extreme case, was the tearful reply. our excellent preceptress always says 'when in doubt, my dears, take an extreme case.' and i was in doubt. does it always succeed her aunt enquired. clara sighed. not always , she reluctantly admitted. and i can't make out why. one day she was telling the little girls they make such a noise at tea, you know 'the more noise you make, the less jam you will have, and vice versa .' and i thought they wouldn't know what ' vice versa ' meant: so i explained it to them. i said 'if you make an infinite noise, you'll get no jam: and if you make no noise, you'll get an infinite lot of jam.' but our excellent preceptress said that wasn't a good instance. why wasn't it she added plaintively. her aunt evaded the question. one sees certain objections to it, she said. but how did you work it with the metropolitan trains none of them go infinitely fast, i believe. i called them hares and tortoises, clara said a little timidly, for she dreaded being laughed at. and i thought there couldn't be so many hares as tortoises on the line: so i took an extreme case one hare and an infinite number of tortoises. an extreme case, indeed, her aunt remarked with admirable gravity: and a most dangerous state of things and i thought, if i went with a tortoise, there would be only one hare to meet: but if i went with the hare you know there were crowds of tortoises it wasn't a bad idea, said the elder lady, as they left the cab, at the entrance of burlington house. you shall have another chance to-day. we'll have a match in marking pictures. clara brightened up. i should like to try again, very much, she said. i'll take more care this time. how are we to play to this question mad mathesis made no reply: she was busy drawing lines down the margins of the catalogue. see, she said after a minute, i've drawn three columns against the names of the pictures in the long room, and i want you to fill them with oughts and crosses crosses for good marks and oughts for bad. the first column is for choice of subject, the second for arrangement, the third for colouring. and these are the conditions of the match. you must give three crosses to two or three pictures. you must give two crosses to four or five do you mean only two crosses said clara. or may i count the three-cross pictures among the two-cross pictures of course you may, said her aunt. any one, that has three eyes, may be said to have two eyes, i suppose clara followed her aunt's dreamy gaze across the crowded gallery, half-dreading to find that there was a three-eyed person in sight. and you must give one cross to nine or ten. and which wins the match clara asked, as she carefully entered these conditions on a blank leaf in her catalogue. whichever marks fewest pictures. but suppose we marked the same number then whichever uses most marks. clara considered. i don't think it's much of a match, she said. i shall mark nine pictures, and give three crosses to three of them, two crosses to two more, and one cross each to all the rest. will you, indeed said her aunt. wait till you've heard all the conditions, my impetuous child. you must give three oughts to one or two pictures, two oughts to three or four, and one ought to eight or nine. i don't want you to be too hard on the r.a.'s. clara quite gasped as she wrote down all these fresh conditions. it's a great deal worse than circulating decimals she said. but i'm determined to win, all the same her aunt smiled grimly. we can begin here , she said, as they paused before a gigantic picture, which the catalogue informed them was the portrait of lieutenant brown, mounted on his favorite elephant. he looks awfully conceited said clara. i don't think he was the elephant's favorite lieutenant. what a hideous picture it is and it takes up room enough for twenty mind what you say, my dear her aunt interposed. it's by an r.a. but clara was quite reckless. i don't care who it's by she cried. and i shall give it three bad marks aunt and niece soon drifted away from each other in the crowd, and for the next half-hour clara was hard at work, putting in marks and rubbing them out again, and hunting up and down for suitable pictures. this she found the hardest part of all. i can't find the one i want she exclaimed at last, almost crying with vexation. what is it you want to find, my dear the voice was strange to clara, but so sweet and gentle that she felt attracted to the owner of it, even before she had seen her; and when she turned, and met the smiling looks of two little old ladies, whose round dimpled faces, exactly alike, seemed never to have known a care, it was as much as she could do as she confessed to aunt mattie afterwards to keep herself from hugging them both. i was looking for a picture, she said, that has a good subject and that's well arranged but badly coloured. the little old ladies glanced at each other in some alarm. calm yourself, my dear, said the one who had spoken first, and try to remember which it was. what was the subject was it an elephant, for instance the other sister suggested. they were still in sight of lieutenant brown. i don't know, indeed clara impetuously replied. you know it doesn't matter a bit what the subject is , so long as it's a good one once more the sisters exchanged looks of alarm, and one of them whispered something to the other, of which clara caught only the one word mad. they mean aunt mattie, of course, she said to herself fancying, in her innocence, that london was like her native town, where everybody knew everybody else. if you mean my aunt, she added aloud, she's there just three pictures beyond lieutenant brown. ah, well then you'd better go to her, my dear her new friend said, soothingly. she'll find you the picture you want. good-bye, dear good-bye, dear echoed the other sister, mind you don't lose sight of your aunt and the pair trotted off into another room, leaving clara rather perplexed at their manner. they're real darlings she soliloquised. i wonder why they pity me so and she wandered on, murmuring to herself it must have two good marks, and one piecee thing that my have got, masked that thing my no can do. you talkee you no sabey what bamboo. they landed, and were at once conducted to the palace. about half way they were met by the governor, who welcomed them in english a great relief to our travellers, whose guide could speak nothing but kgovjnian. i don't half like the way they grin at us as we go by the old man whispered to his son. and why do they say 'bamboo ' so often it alludes to a local custom, replied the governor, who had overheard the question. such persons as happen in any way to displease her radiancy are usually beaten with rods. the old man shuddered. a most objectional local custom he remarked with strong emphasis. i wish we had never landed did you notice that black fellow, norman, opening his great mouth at us i verily believe he would like to eat us norman appealed to the governor, who was walking at his other side. do they often eat distinguished strangers here he said, in as indifferent a tone as he could assume. not often not ever was the welcome reply. they are not good for it. pigs we eat, for they are fat. this old man is thin. and thankful to be so muttered the elder traveller. beaten we shall be without a doubt. it's a comfort to know it won't be beaten without the b my dear boy, just look at the peacocks they were now walking between two unbroken lines of those gorgeous birds, each held in check, by means of a golden collar and chain, by a black slave, who stood well behind, so as not to interrupt the view of the glittering tail, with its network of rustling feathers and its hundred eyes. the governor smiled proudly. in your honour, he said, her radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional peacocks. she will, no doubt, decorate you, before you go, with the usual star and feathers. it'll be star without the s faltered one of his hearers. come, come don't lose heart said the other. all this is full of charm for me. you are young, norman, sighed his father; young and light-hearted. for me, it is charm without the c. the old one is sad, the governor remarked with some anxiety. he has, without doubt, effected some fearful crime but i haven't the poor old gentleman hastily exclaimed. tell him i haven't, norman he has not, as yet, norman gently explained. and the governor repeated, in a satisfied tone, not as yet. yours is a wondrous country the governor resumed, after a pause. now here is a letter from a friend of mine, a merchant, in london. he and his brother went there a year ago, with a thousand pounds apiece; and on new-year's-day they had sixty thousand pounds between them how did they do it norman eagerly exclaimed. even the elder traveller looked excited. the governor handed him the open letter. anybody can do it, when once they know how, so ran this oracular document. we borrowed nought: we stole nought. we began the year with only a thousand pounds apiece: and last new-year's-day we had sixty thousand pounds between us sixty thousand golden sovereigns norman looked grave and thoughtful as he handed back the letter. his father hazarded one guess. was it by gambling a kgovjnian never gambles, said the governor gravely, as he ushered them through the palace gates. they followed him in silence down a long passage, and soon found themselves in a lofty hall, lined entirely with peacocks' feathers. in the centre was a pile of crimson cushions, which almost concealed the figure of her radiancy a plump little damsel, in a robe of green satin dotted with silver stars, whose pale round face lit up for a moment with a half-smile as the travellers bowed before her, and then relapsed into the exact expression of a wax doll, while she languidly murmured a word or two in the kgovjnian dialect. the governor interpreted. her radiancy welcomes you. she notes the impenetrable placidity of the old one, and the imperceptible acuteness of the youth. here the little potentate clapped her hands, and a troop of slaves instantly appeared, carrying trays of coffee and sweetmeats, which they offered to the guests, who had, at a signal from the governor, seated themselves on the carpet. sugar-plums muttered the old man. one might as well be at a confectioner's ask for a penny bun, norman not so loud his son whispered. say something complimentary for the governor was evidently expecting a speech. we thank her exalted potency, the old man timidly began. we bask in the light of her smile, which the words of old men are weak the governor interrupted angrily. let the youth speak tell her, cried norman, in a wild burst of eloquence, that, like two grasshoppers in a volcano, we are shrivelled up in the presence of her spangled vehemence it is well, said the governor, and translated this into kgovjnian. i am now to tell you, he proceeded, what her radiancy requires of you before you go. the yearly competition for the post of imperial scarf-maker is just ended; you are the judges. you will take account of the rate of work, the lightness of the scarves, and their warmth. usually the competitors differ in one point only. thus, last year, fifi and gogo made the same number of scarves in the trial-week, and they were equally light; but fifi's were twice as warm as gogo's and she was pronounced twice as good. but this year, woe is me, who can judge it three competitors are here, and they differ in all points while you settle their claims, you shall be lodged, her radiancy bids me say, free of expense in the best dungeon, and abundantly fed on the best bread and water. the old man groaned. all is lost he wildly exclaimed. but norman heeded him not: he had taken out his note-book, and was calmly jotting down the particulars. three they be, the governor proceeded, lolo, mimi, and zuzu. lolo makesscarves while mimi makes but zuzu makeswhile lolo makes again, so fairylike is zuzu's handiwork,of her scarves weigh no more than one of lolo's; yet mimi's is lighter still-of hers will but balanceof zuzu's and for warmth one of mimi's is equal toof zuzu's; yet one of lolo's is as warm asof mimi's here the little lady once more clapped her hands. it is our signal of dismissal the governor hastily said. pay her radiancy your farewell compliments and walk out backwards. the walking part was all the elder tourist could manage. norman simply said tell her radiancy we are transfixed by the spectacle of her serene brilliance, and bid an agonized farewell to her condensed milkiness her radiancy is pleased, the governor reported, after duly translating this. she casts on you a glance from her imperial eyes, and is confident that you will catch it that i warrant we shall the elder traveller moaned to himself distractedly. once more they bowed low, and then followed the governor down a winding staircase to the imperial dungeon, which they found to be lined with coloured marble, lighted from the roof, and splendidly though not luxuriously furnished with a bench of polished malachite. i trust you will not delay the calculation, the governor said, ushering them in with much ceremony. i have known great inconvenience great and serious inconvenience result to those unhappy ones who have delayed to execute the commands of her radiancy and on this occasion she is resolute: she says the thing must and shall be done: and she has ordered up ten thousand additional bamboos with these words he left them, and they heard him lock and bar the door on the outside. i told you how it would end moaned the elder traveller, wringing his hands, and quite forgetting in his anguish that he had himself proposed the expedition, and had never predicted anything of the sort. oh that we were well out of this miserable business courage cried the younger cheerily. hac olim meminisse juvabit the end of all this will be glory glory without the l was all the poor old man could say, as he rocked himself to and fro on the malachite bench. glory without the l base is the slave that pays. aunt mattie my child would you mind writing it down at once i shall be quite certain to forget it if you don't my dear, we really must wait till the cab stops. how can i possibly write anything in the midst of all this jolting but really i shall be forgetting it clara's voice took the plaintive tone that her aunt never knew how to resist, and with a sigh the old lady drew forth her ivory tablets and prepared to record the amount that clara had just spent at the confectioner's shop. her expenditure was always made out of her aunt's purse, but the poor girl knew, by bitter experience, that sooner or later mad mathesis would expect an exact account of every penny that had gone, and she waited, with ill-concealed impatience, while the old lady turned the tablets over and over, till she had found the one headed petty cash. here's the place, she said at last, and here we have yesterday's luncheon duly entered. one glass lemonade (why can't you drink water, like me ) three sandwiches (they never put in half mustard enough. i told the young woman so, to her face; and she tossed her head like her impudence ) and seven biscuits . total one-and-two-pence. well, now for to-day's one glass of lemonade clara was beginning to say, when suddenly the cab drew up, and a courteous railway-porter was handing out the bewildered girl before she had had time to finish her sentence. her aunt pocketed the tablets instantly. business first, she said: petty cash which is a form of pleasure, whatever you may think afterwards. and she proceeded to pay the driver, and to give voluminous orders about the luggage, quite deaf to the entreaties of her unhappy niece that she would enter the rest of the luncheon account. my dear, you really must cultivate a more capacious mind was all the consolation she vouchsafed to the poor girl. are not the tablets of your memory wide enough to contain the record of one single luncheon not wide enough not half wide enough was the passionate reply. the words came in aptly enough, but the voice was not that of clara, and both ladies turned in some surprise to see who it was that had so suddenly struck into their conversation. a fat little old lady was standing at the door of a cab, helping the driver to extricate what seemed an exact duplicate of herself: it would have been no easy task to decide which was the fatter, or which looked the more good-humoured of the two sisters. i tell you the cab-door isn't half wide enough she repeated, as her sister finally emerged, somewhat after the fashion of a pellet from a pop-gun, and she turned to appeal to clara. is it, dear she said, trying hard to bring a frown into a face that dimpled all over with smiles. some folks is too wide for 'em, growled the cab-driver. don't provoke me, man cried the little old lady, in what she meant for a tempest of fury. say another word and i'll put you into the county court, and sue you for a habeas corpus the cabman touched his hat, and marched off, grinning. nothing like a little law to cow the ruffians, my dear she remarked confidentially to clara. you saw how he quailed when i mentioned the habeas corpus not that i've any idea what it means, but it sounds very grand, doesn't it it's very provoking, clara replied, a little vaguely. very the little old lady eagerly repeated. and we're very much provoked indeed. aren't we, sister i never was so provoked in all my life the fatter sister assented, radiantly. by this time clara had recognised her picture-gallery acquaintances, and, drawing her aunt aside, she hastily whispered her reminiscences. i met them first in the royal academy and they were very kind to me and they were lunching at the next table to us, just now, you know and they tried to help me to find the picture i wanted and i'm sure they're dear old things friends of yours, are they said mad mathesis. well, i like their looks. you can be civil to them, while i get the tickets. but do try and arrange your ideas a little more chronologically and so it came to pass that the four ladies found themselves seated side by side on the same bench waiting for the train, and chatting as if they had known one another for years. now this i call quite a remarkable coincidence exclaimed the smaller and more talkative of the two sisters the one whose legal knowledge had annihilated the cab-driver. not only that we should be waiting for the same train, and at the same station that would be curious enough but actually on the same day, and the same hour of the day that's what strikes me so forcibly she glanced at the fatter and more silent sister, whose chief function in life seemed to be to support the family opinion, and who meekly responded and me too, sister those are not independent coincidences mad mathesis was just beginning, when clara ventured to interpose. there's no jolting here, she pleaded meekly. would you mind writing it down now out came the ivory tablets once more. what was it, then said her aunt. one glass of lemonade, one sandwich, one biscuit oh dear me cried poor clara, the historical tone suddenly changing to a wail of agony. toothache said her aunt calmly, as she wrote down the items. the two sisters instantly opened their reticules and produced two different remedies for neuralgia, each marked unequalled. it isn't that said poor clara. thank you very much. it's only that i can't remember how much i paid well, try and make it out, then, said her aunt. you've got yesterday's luncheon to help you, you know. and here's the luncheon we had the day before the first day we went to that shop one glass lemonade , four sandwiches , ten biscuits . total, one-and-fivepence. she handed the tablets to clara, who gazed at them with eyes so dim with tears that she did not at first notice that she was holding them upside down. the two sisters had been listening to all this with the deepest interest, and at this juncture the smaller one softly laid her hand on clara's arm. do you know, my dear, she said coaxingly, my sister and i are in the very same predicament quite identically the very same predicament aren't we, sister quite identically and absolutely the very began the fatter sister, but she was constructing her sentence on too large a scale, and the little one would not wait for her to finish it. yes, my dear, she resumed; we were lunching at the very same shop as you were and we had two glasses of lemonade and three sandwiches and five biscuits and neither of us has the least idea what we paid. have we, sister quite identically and absolutely murmured the other, who evidently considered that she was now a whole sentence in arrears, and that she ought to discharge one obligation before contracting any fresh liabilities; but the little lady broke in again, and she retired from the conversation a bankrupt. would you make it out for us, my dear pleaded the little old lady. you can do arithmetic, i trust her aunt said, a little anxiously, as clara turned from one tablet to another, vainly trying to collect her thoughts. her mind was a blank, and all human expression was rapidly fading out of her face. a gloomy silence ensued. this little pig went to market: this little pig staid at home. by her radiancy's express command, said the governor, as he conducted the travellers, for the last time, from the imperial presence, i shall now have the ecstasy of escorting you as far as the outer gate of the military quarter, where the agony of parting if indeed nature can survive the shock must be endured from that gate grurmstipths start every quarter of an hour, both ways would you mind repeating that word said norman. grurm grurmstipths, the governor repeated. you call them omnibuses in england. they run both ways, and you can travel by one of them all the way down to the harbour. the old man breathed a sigh of relief; four hours of courtly ceremony had wearied him, and he had been in constant terror lest something should call into use the ten thousand additional bamboos. in another minute they were crossing a large quadrangle, paved with marble, and tastefully decorated with a pigsty in each corner. soldiers, carrying pigs, were marching in all directions: and in the middle stood a gigantic officer giving orders in a voice of thunder, which made itself heard above all the uproar of the pigs. it is the commander-in-chief the governor hurriedly whispered to his companions, who at once followed his example in prostrating themselves before the great man. the commander gravely bowed in return. he was covered with gold lace from head to foot: his face wore an expression of deep misery: and he had a little black pig under each arm. still the gallant fellow did his best, in the midst of the orders he was every moment issuing to his men, to bid a courteous farewell to the departing guests. farewell, oh old one carry these three to the south corner and farewell to thee, thou young one put this fat one on the top of the others in the western sty may your shadows never be less woe is me, it is wrongly done empty out all the sties, and begin again and the soldier leant upon his sword, and wiped away a tear. he is in distress, the governor explained as they left the court. her radiancy has commanded him to place twenty-four pigs in those four sties, so that, as she goes round the court, she may always find the number in each sty nearer to ten than the number in the last. does she call ten nearer to ten than nine is said norman. surely, said the governor. her radiancy would admit that ten is nearer to ten than nine is and also nearer than eleven is. then i think it can be done, said norman. the governor shook his head. the commander has been transferring them in vain for four months, he said. what hope remains and her radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional the pigs don't seem to enjoy being transferred, the old man hastily interrupted. he did not like the subject of bamboos. they are only provisionally transferred, you know, said the governor. in most cases they are immediately carried back again: so they need not mind it. and all is done with the greatest care, under the personal superintendence of the commander-in-chief. of course she would only go once round said norman. alas, no sighed their conductor. round and round. round and round. these are her radiancy's own words. but oh, agony here is the outer gate, and we must part he sobbed as he shook hands with them, and the next moment was briskly walking away. he might have waited to see us off said the old man, piteously. and he needn't have begun whistling the very moment he left us said the young one, severely. but look sharp here are two what's-his-names in the act of starting unluckily, the sea-bound omnibus was full. never mind said norman, cheerily. we'll walk on till the next one overtakes us. they trudged on in silence, both thinking over the military problem, till they met an omnibus coming from the sea. the elder traveller took out his watch. just twelve minutes and a half since we started, he remarked in an absent manner. suddenly the vacant face brightened; the old man had an idea. my boy he shouted, bringing his hand down upon norman's shoulder so suddenly as for a moment to transfer his centre of gravity beyond the base of support. thus taken off his guard, the young man wildly staggered forwards, and seemed about to plunge into space: but in another moment he had gracefully recovered himself. problem in precession and nutation, he remarked in tones where filial respect only just managed to conceal a shade of annoyance. what is it he hastily added, fearing his father might have been taken ill. will you have some brandy when will the next omnibus overtake us when when the old man cried, growing more excited every moment. norman looked gloomy. give me time, he said. i must think it over. and once more the travellers passed on in silence a silence only broken by the distant squeals of the unfortunate little pigs, who were still being provisionally transferred from sty to sty, under the personal superintendence of the commander-in-chief. water, water, every where, nor any drop to drink. it'll just take one more pebble. what ever are you doing with those buckets the speakers were hugh and lambert. place, the beach of little mendip. time,30, p.m. hugh was floating a bucket in another a size larger, and trying how many pebbles it would carry without sinking. lambert was lying on his back, doing nothing. for the next minute or two hugh was silent, evidently deep in thought. suddenly he started. i say, look here, lambert he cried. if it's alive, and slimy, and with legs, i don't care to, said lambert. didn't balbus say this morning that, if a body is immersed in liquid, it displaces as much liquid as is equal to its own bulk said hugh. he said things of that sort, lambert vaguely replied. well, just look here a minute. here's the little bucket almost quite immersed: so the water displaced ought to be just about the same bulk. and now just look at it he took out the little bucket as he spoke, and handed the big one to lambert. why, there's hardly a teacupful do you mean to say that water is the same bulk as the little bucket course it is, said lambert. well, look here again cried hugh, triumphantly, as he poured the water from the big bucket into the little one. why, it doesn't half fill it that's its business, said lambert. if balbus says it's the same bulk, why, it is the same bulk, you know. well, i don't believe it, said hugh. you needn't, said lambert. besides, it's dinner-time. come along. they found balbus waiting dinner for them, and to him hugh at once propounded his difficulty. let's get you helped first, said balbus, briskly cutting away at the joint. you know the old proverb 'mutton first, mechanics afterwards' the boys did not know the proverb, but they accepted it in perfect good faith, as they did every piece of information, however startling, that came from so infallible an authority as their tutor. they ate on steadily in silence, and, when dinner was over, hugh set out the usual array of pens, ink, and paper, while balbus repeated to them the problem he had prepared for their afternoon's task. a friend of mine has a flower-garden a very pretty one, though no great size how big is it said hugh. that's what you have to find out balbus gaily replied. all i tell you is that it is oblong in shape just half a yard longer than its width and that a gravel-walk, one yard wide, begins at one corner and runs all round it. joining into itself said hugh. not joining into itself, young man. just before doing that , it turns a corner, and runs round the garden again, alongside of the first portion, and then inside that again, winding in and in, and each lap touching the last one, till it has used up the whole of the area. like a serpent with corners said lambert. exactly so. and if you walk the whole length of it, to the last inch, keeping in the centre of the path, it's exactly two miles and half a furlong. now, while you find out the length and breadth of the garden, i'll see if i can think out that sea-water puzzle. you said it was a flower-garden hugh inquired, as balbus was leaving the room. i did, said balbus. where do the flowers grow said hugh. but balbus thought it best not to hear the question. he left the boys to their problem, and, in the silence of his own room, set himself to unravel hugh's mechanical paradox. to fix our thoughts, he murmured to himself, as, with hands deep-buried in his pockets, he paced up and down the room, we will take a cylindrical glass jar, with a scale of inches marked up the side, and fill it with water up to theinch mark: and we will assume that every inch depth of jar contains a pint of water. we will now take a solid cylinder, such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to half a pint of water, and plungeinches of it into the water, so that the end of the cylinder comes down to theinch mark. well, that displacespints of water. what becomes of them why, if there were no more cylinder, they would lie comfortably on the top, and fill the jar up to theinch mark. but unfortunately there is more cylinder, occupying half the space between theinch and theinch marks, so that only one pint of water can be accommodated there. what becomes of the other pint why, if there were no more cylinder, it would lie on the top, and fill the jar up to theinch mark. but unfortunately shade of newton he exclaimed, in sudden accents of terror. when does the water stop rising a bright idea struck him. i'll write a little essay on it, he said. balbus's essay. when a solid is immersed in a liquid, it is well known that it displaces a portion of the liquid equal to itself in bulk, and that the level of the liquid rises just so much as it would rise if a quantity of liquid had been added to it, equal in bulk to the solid. lardner says, precisely the same process occurs when a solid is partially immersed: the quantity of liquid displaced, in this case, equalling the portion of the solid which is immersed, and the rise of the level being in proportion. suppose a solid held above the surface of a liquid and partially immersed: a portion of the liquid is displaced, and the level of the liquid rises. but, by this rise of level, a little bit more of the solid is of course immersed, and so there is a new displacement of a second portion of the liquid, and a consequent rise of level. again, this second rise of level causes a yet further immersion, and by consequence another displacement of liquid and another rise. it is self-evident that this process must continue till the entire solid is immersed, and that the liquid will then begin to immerse whatever holds the solid, which, being connected with it, must for the time be considered a part of it. if you hold a stick, six feet long, with its end in a tumbler of water, and wait long enough, you must eventually be immersed. the question as to the source from which the water is supplied which belongs to a high branch of mathematics, and is therefore beyond our present scope does not apply to the sea. let us therefore take the familiar instance of a man standing at the edge of the sea, at ebb-tide, with a solid in his hand, which he partially immerses: he remains steadfast and unmoved, and we all know that he must be drowned. the multitudes who daily perish in this manner to attest a philosophical truth, and whose bodies the unreasoning wave casts sullenly upon our thankless shores, have a truer claim to be called the martyrs of science than a galileo or a kepler. to use kossuth's eloquent phrase, they are the unnamed demigods of the nineteenth century. there's a fallacy somewhere , he murmured drowsily, as he stretched his long legs upon the sofa. i must think it over again. he closed his eyes, in order to concentrate his attention more perfectly, and for the next hour or so his slow and regular breathing bore witness to the careful deliberation with which he was investigating this new and perplexing view of the subject. how very, very sad exclaimed clara; and the eyes of the gentle girl filled with tears as she spoke. sad but very curious when you come to look at it arithmetically, was her aunt's less romantic reply. some of them have lost an arm in their country's service, some a leg, some an ear, some an eye and some, perhaps, all clara murmured dreamily, as they passed the long rows of weather-beaten heroes basking in the sun. did you notice that very old one, with a red face, who was drawing a map in the dust with his wooden leg, and all the others watching i think it was a plan of a battle the battle of trafalgar, no doubt, her aunt interrupted, briskly. hardly that, i think, clara ventured to say. you see, in that case, he couldn't well be alive couldn't well be alive the old lady contemptuously repeated. he's as lively as you and me put together why, if drawing a map in the dust with one's wooden leg doesn't prove one to be alive, perhaps you'll kindly mention what does prove it clara did not see her way out of it. logic had never been her forte . to return to the arithmetic, mad mathesis resumed the eccentric old lady never let slip an opportunity of driving her niece into a calculation what percentage do you suppose must have lost all four a leg, an arm, an eye, and an ear how can i tell gasped the terrified girl. she knew well what was coming. you can't, of course, without data , her aunt replied: but i'm just going to give you give her a chelsea bun, miss that's what most young ladies likes best the voice was rich and musical, and the speaker dexterously whipped back the snowy cloth that covered his basket, and disclosed a tempting array of the familiar square buns, joined together in rows, richly egged and browned, and glistening in the sun. no, sir i shall give her nothing so indigestible be off the old lady waved her parasol threateningly: but nothing seemed to disturb the good-humour of the jolly old man, who marched on, chanting his melodious refrain: far too indigestible, my love said the old lady. percentages will agree with you ever so much better clara sighed, and there was a hungry look in her eyes as she watched the basket lessening in the distance: but she meekly listened to the relentless old lady, who at once proceeded to count off the data on her fingers. say thatper cent. have lost an eye-per cent. an ear-per cent. an arm-per cent. a leg that'll do it beautifully. now, my dear, what percentage, at least , must have lost all four no more conversation occurred unless a smothered exclamation of piping hot which escaped from clara's lips as the basket vanished round a corner could be counted as such until they reached the old chelsea mansion, where clara's father was then staying, with his three sons and their old tutor. balbus, lambert, and hugh had entered the house only a few minutes before them. they had been out walking, and hugh had been propounding a difficulty which had reduced lambert to the depths of gloom, and had even puzzled balbus. it changes from wednesday to thursday at midnight, doesn't it hugh had begun. sometimes, said balbus, cautiously. always, said lambert, decisively. sometimes , balbus gently insisted. six midnights out of seven, it changes to some other name. i meant, of course, hugh corrected himself, when it does change from wednesday to thursday, it does it at midnight and only at midnight. surely, said balbus. lambert was silent. well, now, suppose it's midnight here in chelsea. then it's wednesday west of chelsea (say in ireland or america) where midnight hasn't arrived yet: and it's thursday east of chelsea (say in germany or russia) where midnight has just passed by surely, balbus said again. even lambert nodded this time. but it isn't midnight, anywhere else; so it can't be changing from one day to another anywhere else. and yet, if ireland and america and so on call it wednesday, and germany and russia and so on call it thursday, there must be some place not chelsea that has different days on the two sides of it. and the worst of it is, the people there get their days in the wrong order: they've got wednesday east of them, and thursday west just as if their day had changed from thursday to wednesday i've heard that puzzle before cried lambert. and i'll tell you the explanation. when a ship goes round the world from east to west, we know that it loses a day in its reckoning: so that when it gets home, and calls its day wednesday, it finds people here calling it thursday, because we've had one more midnight than the ship has had. and when you go the other way round you gain a day. i know all that, said hugh, in reply to this not very lucid explanation: but it doesn't help me, because the ship hasn't proper days. one way round, you get more than twenty-four hours to the day, and the other way you get less: so of course the names get wrong: but people that live on in one place always get twenty-four hours to the day. i suppose there is such a place, balbus said, meditatively, though i never heard of it. and the people must find it very queer, as hugh says, to have the old day east of them, and the new one west : because, when midnight comes round to them, with the new day in front of it and the old one behind it, one doesn't see exactly what happens. i must think it over. so they had entered the house in the state i have described balbus puzzled, and lambert buried in gloomy thought. yes, m'm, master is at home, m'm, said the stately old butler. (n.b. it is only a butler of experience who can manage a series of three m's together, without any interjacent vowels.) and the ole party is a-waiting for you in the libery. i don't like his calling your father an old party, mad mathesis whispered to her niece, as they crossed the hall. and clara had only just time to whisper in reply he meant the whole party, before they were ushered into the library, and the sight of the five solemn faces there assembled chilled her into silence. her father sat at the head of the table, and mutely signed to the ladies to take the two vacant chairs, one on each side of him. his three sons and balbus completed the party. writing materials had been arranged round the table, after the fashion of a ghostly banquet: the butler had evidently bestowed much thought on the grim device. sheets of quarto paper, each flanked by a pen on one side and a pencil on the other, represented the plates penwipers did duty for rolls of bread while ink-bottles stood in the places usually occupied by wine-glasses. the piece de resistance was a large green baize bag, which gave forth, as the old man restlessly lifted it from side to side, a charming jingle, as of innumerable golden guineas. sister, daughter, sons and balbus , the old man began, so nervously, that balbus put in a gentle hear, hear while hugh drummed on the table with his fists. this disconcerted the unpractised orator. sister he began again, then paused a moment, moved the bag to the other side, and went on with a rush, i mean this being a critical occasion more or less being the year when one of my sons comes of age he paused again in some confusion, having evidently got into the middle of his speech sooner than he intended: but it was too late to go back. hear, hear cried balbus. quite so, said the old gentleman, recovering his self-possession a little: when first i began this annual custom my friend balbus will correct me if i am wrong (hugh whispered with a strap but nobody heard him except lambert, who only frowned and shook his head at him) this annual custom of giving each of my sons as many guineas as would represent his age it was a critical time so balbus informed me as the ages of two of you were together equal to that of the third so on that occasion i made a speech he paused so long that balbus thought it well to come to the rescue with the words it was a most but the old man checked him with a warning look: yes, made a speech, he repeated. a few years after that, balbus pointed out i say pointed out (hear, hear cried balbus. quite so, said the grateful old man.) that it was another critical occasion. the ages of two of you were together double that of the third. so i made another speech another speech. and now again it's a critical occasion so balbus says and i am making (here mad mathesis pointedly referred to her watch) all the haste i can the old man cried, with wonderful presence of mind. indeed, sister, i'm coming to the point now the number of years that have passed since that first occasion is just two-thirds of the number of guineas i then gave you. now, my boys, calculate your ages from the data , and you shall have the money but we know our ages cried hugh. silence, sir thundered the old man, rising to his full height (he was exactly five-foot five) in his indignation. i say you must use the data only you mustn't even assume which it is that comes of age he clutched the bag as he spoke, and with tottering steps (it was about as much as he could do to carry it) he left the room. and you shall have a similar cadeau , the old lady whispered to her niece, when you've calculated that percentage and she followed her brother. nothing could exceed the solemnity with which the old couple had risen from the table, and yet was it was it a grin with which the father turned away from his unhappy sons could it be could it be a wink with which the aunt abandoned her despairing niece and were those were those sounds of suppressed chuckling which floated into the room, just before balbus (who had followed them out) closed the door surely not: and yet the butler told the cook but no, that was merely idle gossip, and i will not repeat it. the shades of evening granted their unuttered petition, and closed not o'er them (for the butler brought in the lamp): the same obliging shades left them a lonely bark (the wail of a dog, in the back-yard, baying the moon) for awhile: but neither morn, alas, (nor any other epoch) seemed likely to restore them to that peace of mind which had once been theirs ere ever these problems had swooped upon them, and crushed them with a load of unfathomable mystery it's hardly fair, muttered hugh, to give us such a jumble as this to work out fair clara echoed, bitterly. well and to all my readers i can but repeat the last words of gentle clara fare-well twenty-seven answers have come in. of these,are right,partially right, andwrong. thegive the distance correctly, but they have failed to grasp the fact that the top of the hill might have been reached at any moment betweeno'clock and i grant you (i), but i deny (ii): it rests on the assumption that to go part of the time atmiles an hour, and the rest atmiles an hour, comes to the same result as going the whole time at1miles an hour. but this would only be true if the part were an exact half , i.e., if they went up hill forhours, and down hill for the other which they certainly did not do. and now descend, ye classic nine who have solved the whole problem, and let me sing your praises. your names are blithe, e. w., l. b., a marlborough boy, o. v. l., putney walker, rose, sea breeze, simple susan, and money spinner. (these last two i count as one, as they send a joint answer.) rose and simple susan and co. do not actually state that the hill-top was reached some time betweenand but, as they have clearly grasped the fact that a mile, ascended and descended, took the same time as two level miles, i mark them as right. a marlborough boy and putney walker deserve honourable mention for their algebraical solutions being the only two who have perceived that the question leads to an indeterminate equation . e. w. brings a charge of untruthfulness against the aged knight a serious charge, for he was the very pink of chivalry she says according to the data given, the time at the summit affords no clue to the total distance. it does not enable us to state precisely to an inch how much level and how much hill there was on the road. fair damsel, the aged knight replies, if, as i surmise, thy initials denote early womanhood bethink thee that the word 'enable' is thine, not mine. i did but ask the time of reaching the hill-top as my condition for further parley. if now thou wilt not grant that i am a truth-loving man, then will i affirm that those same initials denote envenomed wickedness blithe has made so ingenious an addition to the problem, and simple susan and co. have solved it in such tuneful verse, that i record both their answers in full. i have altered a word or two in blithe's which i trust she will excuse; it did not seem quite clear as it stood. yet stay, said the youth, as a gleam of inspiration lighted up the relaxing muscles of his quiescent features. stay. methinks it matters little when we reached that summit, the crown of our toil. for in the space of time wherein we clambered up one mile and bounded down the same on our return, we could have trudged the twain on the level. we have plodded, then, four-and-twenty miles in these six mortal hours; for never a moment did we stop for catching of fleeting breath or for gazing on the scene around very good, said the old man. twelve miles out and twelve miles in. and we reached the top some time between six and seven of the clock. now mark me for every five minutes that had fled since six of the clock when we stood on yonder peak, so many miles had we toiled upwards on the dreary mountainside the youth moaned and rushed into the hostel. blithe. the elder and the younger knight, they sallied forth at three; how far they went on level ground it matters not to me; what time they reached the foot of hill, when they began to mount, are problems which i hold to be of very small account. the moment that each waved his hat upon the topmost peak to trivial query such as this no answer will i seek. yet can i tell the distance well they must have travelled o'er: on hill and plain, 'twixt three and nine, the miles were twenty-four. four miles an hour their steady pace along the level track, three when they climbed but six when they came swiftly striding back adown the hill; and little skill it needs, methinks, to show, up hill and down together told, four miles an hour they go. for whether long or short the time upon the hill they spent, two thirds were passed in going up, one third in the descent. two thirds at three, one third at six, if rightly reckoned o'er, will make one whole at four the tale is tangled now no more. ten answers have been received. of these, one is wrong, galanthus nivalis major, who insists on inviting two guests, one being the governor's wife's brother's father . if she had taken his sister's husband's father instead, she would have found it possible to reduce the guests to one . of the nine who send right answers, sea-breeze is the very faintest breath that ever bore the name she simply states that the governor's uncle might fulfill all the conditions by intermarriages wind of the western sea, you have had a very narrow escape be thankful to appear in the class-list at all bog-oak and bradshaw of the future use genealogies which requirepeople instead of by inviting the governor's father's sister's husband instead of his father's wife's brother . i cannot think this so good a solution as one that requires only caius and valentine deserve special mention as the only two who have supplied genealogies. \""
