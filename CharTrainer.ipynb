       "\" supposing that truth is a woman what then is there not ground for suspecting that all philosophers, in so far as they have been dogmatists, have failed to understand women that the terrible seriousness and clumsy importunity with which they have usually paid their addresses to truth, have been unskilled and unseemly methods for winning a woman certainly she has never allowed herself to be won; and at present every kind of dogma stands with sad and discouraged mien if, indeed, it stands at all for there are scoffers who maintain that it has fallen, that all dogma lies on the ground nay more, that it is at its last gasp. but to speak seriously, there are good grounds for hoping that all dogmatizing in philosophy, whatever solemn, whatever conclusive and decided airs it has assumed, may have been only a noble puerilism and tyronism; and probably the time is at hand when it will be once and again understood what has actually sufficed for the basis of such imposing and absolute philosophical edifices as the dogmatists have hitherto reared: perhaps some popular superstition of immemorial time (such as the soul-superstition, which, in the form of subject- and ego-superstition, has not yet ceased doing mischief): perhaps some play upon words, a deception on the part of grammar, or an audacious generalization of very restricted, very personal, very human all-too-human facts. the philosophy of the dogmatists, it is to be hoped, was only a promise for thousands of years afterwards, as was astrology in still earlier times, in the service of which probably more labour, gold, acuteness, and patience have been spent than on any actual science hitherto: we owe to it, and to its super-terrestrial pretensions in asia and egypt, the grand style of architecture. it seems that in order to inscribe themselves upon the heart of humanity with everlasting claims, all great things have first to wander about the earth as enormous and awe-inspiring caricatures: dogmatic philosophy has been a caricature of this kind for instance, the vedanta doctrine in asia, and platonism in europe. let us not be ungrateful to it, although it must certainly be confessed that the worst, the most tiresome, and the most dangerous of errors hitherto has been a dogmatist error namely, plato's invention of pure spirit and the good in itself. but now when it has been surmounted, when europe, rid of this nightmare, can again draw breath freely and at least enjoy a healthier sleep, we, whose duty is wakefulness itself, are the heirs of all the strength which the struggle against this error has fostered. it amounted to the very inversion of truth, and the denial of the perspective the fundamental condition of life, to speak of spirit and the good as plato spoke of them; indeed one might ask, as a physician: how did such a malady attack that finest product of antiquity, plato had the wicked socrates really corrupted him was socrates after all a corrupter of youths, and deserved his hemlock but the struggle against plato, or to speak plainer, and for the people the struggle against the ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums of christianity (for christianity is platonism for the people), produced in europe a magnificent tension of soul, such as had not existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals. as a matter of fact, the european feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice attempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow: once by means of jesuitism, and the second time by means of democratic enlightenment which, with the aid of liberty of the press and newspaper-reading, might, in fact, bring it about that the spirit would not so easily find itself in distress (the germans invented gunpowder all credit to them but they again made things square they invented printing.) but we, who are neither jesuits, nor democrats, nor even sufficiently germans, we good europeans, and free, very free spirits we have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the tension of its bow and perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and, who knows the goal to aim at.... sils maria upper engadine, june, chapter i. prejudices of philosophers the will to truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous enterprise, the famous truthfulness of which all philosophers have hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this will to truth not laid before us what strange, perplexing, questionable questions it is already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. is it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn impatiently away that this sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions ourselves who is it really that puts questions to us here what really is this will to truth in us in fact we made a long halt at the question as to the origin of this will until at last we came to an absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. we inquired about the value of this will. granted that we want the truth: why not rather untruth and uncertainty even ignorance the problem of the value of truth presented itself before us or was it we who presented ourselves before the problem which of us is the oedipus here which the sphinx it would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of interrogation. and could it be believed that it at last seems to us as if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first to discern it, get a sight of it, and risk raising it for there is risk in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk. how could anything originate out of its opposite for example, truth out of error or the will to truth out of the will to deception or the generous deed out of selfishness or the pure sun-bright vision of the wise man out of covetousness such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams of it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest value must have a different origin, an origin of their own in this transitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of delusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source. but rather in the lap of being, in the intransitory, in the concealed god, in the 'thing-in-itself there must be their source, and nowhere else this mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which metaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation is at the back of all their logical procedure; through this belief of theirs, they exert themselves for their knowledge, for something that is in the end solemnly christened the truth. the fundamental belief of metaphysicians is the belief in antitheses of values. it never occurred even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold (where doubt, however, was most necessary); though they had made a solemn vow, de omnibus dubitandum. for it may be doubted, firstly, whether antitheses exist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their seal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely provisional perspectives, besides being probably made from some corner, perhaps from below frog perspectives, as it were, to borrow an expression current among painters. in spite of all the value which may belong to the true, the positive, and the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to pretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity. it might even be possible that what constitutes the value of those good and respected things, consists precisely in their being insidiously related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed things perhaps even in being essentially identical with them. perhaps but who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous perhapses for that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of philosophers, such as will have other tastes and inclinations, the reverse of those hitherto prevalent philosophers of the dangerous perhaps in every sense of the term. and to speak in all seriousness, i see such new philosophers beginning to appear. having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between their lines long enough, i now say to myself that the greater part of conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here to learn anew, as one learned anew about heredity and innateness. as little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process and procedure of heredity, just as little is being-conscious opposed to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his instincts, and forced into definite channels. and behind all logic and its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak more plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite mode of life for example, that the certain is worth more than the uncertain, that illusion is less valuable than truth such valuations, in spite of their regulative importance for us, might notwithstanding be only superficial valuations, special kinds of niaiserie , such as may be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves. supposing, in effect, that man is not just the measure of things. the falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. the question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of reality with the purely imagined world of the absolute and immutable, without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not live that the renunciation of false opinions would be a renunciation of life, a negation of life. to recognise untruth as a condition of life; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil. that which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they are how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in short, how childish and childlike they are, but that there is not enough honest dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in the remotest manner. they all pose as though their real opinions had been discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure, divinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics, who, fairer and foolisher, talk of inspiration), whereas, in fact, a prejudiced proposition, idea, or suggestion, which is generally their heart's desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with arguments sought out after the event. they are all advocates who do not wish to be regarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their prejudices, which they dub truths, and very far from having the conscience which bravely admits this to itself, very far from having the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be understood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful confidence and self-ridicule. the spectacle of the tartuffery of old kant, equally stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic by-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his categorical imperative makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical preachers. or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by means of which spinoza has, as it were, clad his philosophy in mail and mask in fact, the love of his wisdom, to translate the term fairly and squarely in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible maiden, that pallas athene: how much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray it has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has consisted of namely, the confession of its originator, and a species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover that the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown. indeed, to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a philosopher have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first ask oneself: what morality do they (or does he) aim at accordingly, i do not believe that an impulse to knowledge is the father of philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge ) as an instrument. but whoever considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining how far they may have here acted as inspiring genii (or as demons and cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate lord over all the other impulses. for every impulse is imperious, and as such, attempts to philosophize. to be sure, in the case of scholars, in the case of really scientific men, it may be otherwise better, if you will; there there may really be such a thing as an impulse to knowledge, some kind of small, independent clock-work, which, when well wound up, works away industriously to that end, without the rest of the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein. the actual interests of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another direction in the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics; it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a good philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not characterised by becoming this or that. in the philosopher, on the contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all, his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to who he is, that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature stand to each other. how malicious philosophers can be i know of nothing more stinging than the joke epicurus took the liberty of making on plato and the platonists; he called them dionysiokolakes. in its original sense, and on the face of it, the word signifies flatterers of dionysius consequently, tyrants' accessories and lick-spittles; besides this, however, it is as much as to say, they are all actors, there is nothing genuine about them (for dionysiokolax was a popular name for an actor). and the latter is really the malignant reproach that epicurus cast upon plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the mise en scene style of which plato and his scholars were masters of which epicurus was not a master he, the old school-teacher of samos, who sat concealed in his little garden at athens, and wrote three hundred books, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of plato, who knows greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-god epicurus really was. did she ever find out there is a point in every philosophy at which the conviction of the philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the words of an ancient mystery: adventavit asinus, pulcher et fortissimus. you desire to live according to nature oh, you noble stoics, what fraud of words imagine to yourselves a being like nature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain: imagine to yourselves indifference as a power how could you live in accordance with such indifference to live is not that just endeavouring to be otherwise than this nature is not living valuing, preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different and granted that your imperative, living according to nature, means actually the same as living according to life how could you do differently why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves are, and must be in reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you: while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in nature, you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players and self-deluders in your pride you wish to dictate your morals and ideals to nature, to nature herself, and to incorporate them therein; you insist that it shall be nature according to the stoa, and would like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal glorification and generalism of stoicism with all your love for truth, you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such hypnotic rigidity to see nature falsely, that is to say, stoically, that you are no longer able to see it otherwise and to crown all, some unfathomable superciliousness gives you the bedlamite hope that because you are able to tyrannize over yourselves stoicism is self-tyranny nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is not the stoic a part of nature ... but this is an old and everlasting story: what happened in old times with the stoics still happens today, as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. it always creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual will to power, the will to creation of the world, the will to the causa prima. the eagerness and subtlety, i should even say craftiness, with which the problem of the real and the apparent world is dealt with at present throughout europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and he who hears only a will to truth in the background, and nothing else, cannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears. in rare and isolated cases, it may really have happened that such a will to truth a certain extravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician's ambition of the forlorn hope has participated therein: that which in the end always prefers a handful of certainty to a whole cartload of beautiful possibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience, who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an uncertain something. but that is nihilism, and the sign of a despairing, mortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a virtue may display. it seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. in that they side against appearance, and speak superciliously of perspective, in that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the credibility of the ocular evidence that the earth stands still, and thus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession to escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly than in one's body ), who knows if they are not really trying to win back something which was formerly an even securer possession, something of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the immortal soul, perhaps the old god, in short, ideas by which they could live better, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by modern ideas there is distrust of these modern ideas in this mode of looking at things, a disbelief in all that has been constructed yesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety and scorn, which can no longer endure the bric-a-brac of ideas of the most varied origin, such as so-called positivism at present throws on the market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair motleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom there is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness. therein it seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists and knowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels them from modern reality, is unrefuted... what do their retrograde by-paths concern us the main thing about them is not that they wish to go back, but that they wish to get away therefrom. a little more strength, swing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be off and not back it seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to divert attention from the actual influence which kant exercised on german philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which he set upon himself. kant was first and foremost proud of his table of categories; with it in his hand he said: this is the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics. let us only understand this could be he was proud of having discovered a new faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. granting that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid flourishing of german philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible something at all events new faculties of which to be still prouder but let us reflect for a moment it is high time to do so. how are synthetic judgments a priori possible kant asks himself and what is really his answer by means of a means (faculty) but unfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly, and with such display of german profundity and verbal flourishes, that one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved in such an answer. people were beside themselves with delight over this new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when kant further discovered a moral faculty in man for at that time germans were still moral, not yet dabbling in the politics of hard fact. then came the honeymoon of german philosophy. all the young theologians of the tubingen institution went immediately into the groves all seeking for faculties. and what did they not find in that innocent, rich, and still youthful period of the german spirit, to which romanticism, the malicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish between finding and inventing above all a faculty for the transcendental; schelling christened it, intellectual intuition, and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally pious-inclined germans. one can do no greater wrong to the whole of this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness, notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and senile conceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with moral indignation. enough, however the world grew older, and the dream vanished. a time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still rub them today. people had been dreaming, and first and foremost old kant. by means of a means (faculty) he had said, or at least meant to say. but, is that an answer an explanation or is it not rather merely a repetition of the question how does opium induce sleep by means of a means (faculty), namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in moliere, quia est in eo virtus dormitiva, cujus est natura sensus assoupire. but such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time to replace the kantian question, how are synthetic judgments a priori possible by another question, why is belief in such judgments necessary in effect, it is high time that we should understand that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might naturally be false judgments or, more plainly spoken, and roughly and readily synthetic judgments a priori should not be possible at all; we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false judgments. only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view of life. and finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which german philosophy i hope you understand its right to inverted commas (goosefeet) has exercised throughout the whole of europe, there is no doubt that a certain virtus dormitiva had a share in it; thanks to german philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous, the mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths christians, and the political obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the still overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into this, in short sensus assoupire.... as regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted theories that have been advanced, and in europe there is now perhaps no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious signification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an abbreviation of the means of expression) thanks chiefly to the pole boscovich: he and the pole copernicus have hitherto been the greatest and most successful opponents of ocular evidence. for while copernicus has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth does not stand fast, boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the last thing that stood fast of the earth the belief in substance, in matter, in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. one must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war to the knife, against the atomistic requirements which still lead a dangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more celebrated metaphysical requirements: one must also above all give the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which christianity has taught best and longest, the soul-atomism. let it be permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the soul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as a monad, as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science between ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of the soul thereby, and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses as happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly touch on the soul without immediately losing it. but the way is open for new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such conceptions as mortal soul, and soul of subjective multiplicity, and soul as social structure of the instincts and passions, want henceforth to have legitimate rights in science. in that the new psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into a new desert and a new distrust it is possible that the older psychologists had a merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds that precisely thereby he is also condemned to invent and, who knows perhaps to discover the new. psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic being. a living thing seeks above all to discharge its strength life itself is will to power; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent results thereof. in short, here, as everywhere else, let us beware of superfluous teleological principles one of which is the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to spinoza's inconsistency). it is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must be essentially economy of principles. it is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according to us, if i may say so ) and not a world-explanation; but in so far as it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a long time to come must be regarded as more namely, as an explanation. it has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and convincingly upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes in fact, it follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism. what is clear, what is explained only that which can be seen and felt one must pursue every problem thus far. obversely, however, the charm of the platonic mode of thought, which was an aristocratic mode, consisted precisely in resistance to obvious sense-evidence perhaps among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses the mob of the senses, as plato said. in this overcoming of the world, and interpreting of the world in the manner of plato, there was an enjoyment different from that which the physicists of today offer us and likewise the darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workers, with their principle of the smallest possible effort, and the greatest possible blunder. where there is nothing more to see or to grasp, there is also nothing more for men to do that is certainly an imperative different from the platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right imperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-builders of the future, who have nothing but rough work to perform. to study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as heuristic principle. what and others say even that the external world is the work of our organs but then our body, as a part of this external world, would be the work of our organs but then our organs themselves would be the work of our organs it seems to me that this is a complete reductio ad absurdum, if the conception causa sui is something fundamentally absurd. consequently, the external world is not the work of our organs there are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are immediate certainties; for instance, i think, or as the superstition of schopenhauer puts it, i will; as though cognition here got hold of its object purely and simply as the thing in itself, without any falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the object. i would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that immediate certainty, as well as absolute knowledge and the thing in itself, involve a contradictio in adjecto; we really ought to free ourselves from the misleading significance of words the people on their part may think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the philosopher must say to himself: when i analyze the process that is expressed in the sentence, 'i think,' i find a whole series of daring assertions, the argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps impossible: for instance, that it is i who think, that there must necessarily be something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,' and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by thinking that i know what thinking is. for if i had not already decided within myself what it is, by what standard could i determine whether that which is just happening is not perhaps 'willing' or 'feeling' in short, the assertion 'i think,' assumes that i compare my state at the present moment with other states of myself which i know, in order to determine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with further 'knowledge,' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for me. in place of the immediate certainty in which the people may believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable conscience questions of the intellect, to wit: whence did i get the notion of 'thinking' why do i believe in cause and effect what gives me the right to speak of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally of an 'ego' as cause of thought he who ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a sort of intuitive perception, like the person who says, i think, and know that this, at least, is true, actual, and certain will encounter a smile and two notes of interrogation in a philosopher nowadays. sir, the philosopher will perhaps give him to understand, it is improbable that you are not mistaken, but why should it be the truth with regard to the superstitions of logicians, i shall never tire of emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by these credulous minds namely, that a thought comes when it wishes, and not when i wish; so that it is a perversion of the facts of the case to say that the subject i is the condition of the predicate think. one thinks; but that this one is precisely the famous old ego, is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and assuredly not an immediate certainty. after all, one has even gone too far with this one thinks even the one contains an interpretation of the process, and does not belong to the process itself. one infers here according to the usual grammatical formula to think is an activity; every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently... it was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought, besides the operating power, the material particle wherein it resides and out of which it operates the atom. more rigorous minds, however, learnt at last to get along without this earth-residuum, and perhaps some day we shall accustom ourselves, even from the logician's point of view, to get along without the little one (to which the worthy old ego has refined itself). it is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle minds. it seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the free will owes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearing who feels himself strong enough to refute it. philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were the best-known thing in the world; indeed, schopenhauer has given us to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and completely known, without deduction or addition. but it again and again seems to me that in this case schopenhauer also only did what philosophers are in the habit of doing he seems to have adopted a popular prejudice and exaggerated it. willing seems to me to be above all something complicated, something that is a unity only in name and it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages. so let us for once be more cautious, let us be unphilosophical: let us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations, namely, the sensation of the condition away from which we go, the sensation of the condition towards which we go, the sensation of this from and towards itself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular sensation, which, even without our putting in motion arms and legs, commences its action by force of habit, directly we will anything. therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place, thinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there is a ruling thought; and let us not imagine it possible to sever this thought from the willing, as if the will would then remain over in the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking, but it is above all an emotion, and in fact the emotion of the command. that which is termed freedom of the will is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: i am free, 'he' must obey this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so the straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that this and nothing else is necessary now, the inward certainty that obedience will be rendered and whatever else pertains to the position of the commander. a man who wills commands something within himself which renders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience. but now let us notice what is the strangest thing about the will, this affair so extremely complex, for which the people have only one name. inasmuch as in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding and the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term i: a whole series of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the will itself, has become attached to the act of willing to such a degree that he who wills believes firmly that willing suffices for action. since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will when the effect of the command consequently obedience, and therefore action was to be expected, the appearance has translated itself into the sentiment, as if there were a necessity of effect; in a word, he who wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing, to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation of power which accompanies all success. freedom of will that is the expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with the executor of the order who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will that overcame them. in this way the person exercising volition adds the feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful underwills or under-souls indeed, our body is but a social structure composed of many souls to his feelings of delight as commander. l'effet c'est moi. what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed and happy commonwealth, namely, that the governing class identifies itself with the successes of the commonwealth. in all willing it is absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as already said, of a social structure composed of many souls, on which account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such within the sphere of morals regarded as the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of life manifests itself. that the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with each other, that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to a system as the collective members of the fauna of a continent is betrayed in the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the most diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme of possible philosophies. under an invisible spell, they always revolve once more in the same orbit, however independent of each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something within them leads them, something impels them in definite order the one after the other to wit, the innate methodology and relationship of their ideas. their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off, ancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly grew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order. the wonderful family resemblance of all indian, greek, and german philosophizing is easily enough explained. in fact, where there is affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of grammar i mean owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical functions it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems, just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of world-interpretation. it is highly probable that philosophers within the domain of the ural-altaic languages (where the conception of the subject is least developed) look otherwise into the world, and will be found on paths of thought different from those of the indo-germans and mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately also the spell of physiological valuations and racial conditions. so much by way of rejecting locke's superficiality with regard to the origin of ideas. the causa sui is the best self-contradiction that has yet been conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and frightfully with this very folly. the desire for freedom of will in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway, unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and to absolve god, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom, involves nothing less than to be precisely this causa sui, and, with more than munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the hair, out of the slough of nothingness. if any one should find out in this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of free will and put it out of his head altogether, i beg of him to carry his enlightenment a step further, and also put out of his head the contrary of this monstrous conception of free will: i mean non-free will, which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect. one should not wrongly materialise cause and effect, as the natural philosophers do (and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at present), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes the cause press and push until it effects its end; one should use cause and effect only as pure conceptions, that is to say, as conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual understanding, not for explanation. in being-in-itself there is nothing of casual-connection, of necessity, or of psychological non-freedom; there the effect does not follow the cause, there law does not obtain. it is we alone who have devised cause, sequence, reciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive, and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world, as being-in-itself, with things, we act once more as we have always acted mythologically. the non-free will is mythology; in real life it is only a question of strong and weak wills. it is almost always a symptom of what is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every causal-connection and psychological necessity, manifests something of compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom; it is suspicious to have such feelings the person betrays himself. and in general, if i have observed correctly, the non-freedom of the will is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but always in a profoundly personal manner: some will not give up their responsibility, their belief in themselves, the personal right to their merits, at any price (the vain races belong to this class); others on the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed for anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to get out of the business, no matter how. the latter, when they write books, are in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort of socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. and as a matter of fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly when it can pose as la religion de la souffrance humaine; that is its good taste. let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot desist from the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation, but nature's conformity to law, of which you physicists talk so proudly, as though why, it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad philology. it is no matter of fact, no text, but rather just a naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning, with which you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern soul everywhere equality before the law nature is not different in that respect, nor better than we: a fine instance of secret motive, in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and autocratic likewise a second and more refined atheism is once more disguised. ni dieu, ni maitre that, also, is what you want; and therefore cheers for natural law is it not so but, as has been said, that is interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along, who, with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation, could read out of the same nature, and with regard to the same phenomena, just the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims of power an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and unconditionalness of all will to power before your eyes, that almost every word, and the word tyranny itself, would eventually seem unsuitable, or like a weakening and softening metaphor as being too human; and who should, nevertheless, end by asserting the same about this world as you do, namely, that it has a necessary and calculable course, not, however, because laws obtain in it, but because they are absolutely lacking, and every power effects its ultimate consequences every moment. granted that this also is only interpretation and you will be eager enough to make this objection well, so much the better. all psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths. in so far as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written, evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent, it seems as if nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the morphology and development-doctrine of the will to power, as i conceive of it. the power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most intellectual world, the world apparently most indifferent and unprejudiced, and has obviously operated in an injurious, obstructive, blinding, and distorting manner. a proper physio-psychology has to contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator, it has the heart against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal conditionalness of the good and the bad impulses, causes (as refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong and manly conscience still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good impulses from bad ones. if, however, a person should regard even the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and imperiousness as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be present, fundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life (which must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further developed), he will suffer from such a view of things as from sea-sickness. and yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous knowledge, and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one should keep away from it who can do so on the other hand, if one has once drifted hither with one's bark, well very good now let us set our teeth firmly let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm we sail away right over morality, we crush out, we destroy perhaps the remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither but what do we matter. never yet did a profounder world of insight reveal itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who thus makes a sacrifice it is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto, on the contrary will at least be entitled to demand in return that psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences, for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist. for psychology is once more the path to the fundamental problems. chapter ii. the free spirit o sancta simplicitiatas in what strange simplification and falsification man lives one can never cease wondering when once one has got eyes for beholding this marvel how we have made everything around us clear and free and easy and simple how we have been able to give our senses a passport to everything superficial, our thoughts a godlike desire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences how from the beginning, we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost inconceivable freedom, thoughtlessness, imprudence, heartiness, and gaiety in order to enjoy life and only on this solidified, granite-like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself hitherto, the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful will, the will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue not as its opposite, but as its refinement it is to be hoped, indeed, that language, here as elsewhere, will not get over its awkwardness, and that it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees and many refinements of gradation; it is equally to be hoped that the incarnated tartuffery of morals, which now belongs to our unconquerable flesh and blood, will turn the words round in the mouths of us discerning ones. here and there we understand it, and laugh at the way in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this simplified, thoroughly artificial, suitably imagined, and suitably falsified world: at the way in which, whether it will or not, it loves error, because, as living itself, it loves life after such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would fain be heard; it appeals to the most serious minds. take care, ye philosophers and friends of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom of suffering for the truth's sake even in your own defense it spoils all the innocence and fine neutrality of your conscience; it makes you headstrong against objections and red rags; it stupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when in the struggle with danger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even worse consequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card as protectors of truth upon earth as though the truth were such an innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors and you of all people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance, messrs loafers and cobweb-spinners of the spirit finally, ye know sufficiently well that it cannot be of any consequence if ye just carry your point; ye know that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point, and that there might be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines (and occasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime and trumping games before accusers and law-courts rather go out of the way flee into concealment and have your masks and your ruses, that ye may be mistaken for what you are, or somewhat feared and pray, don't forget the garden, the garden with golden trellis-work and have people around you who are as a garden or as music on the waters at eventide, when already the day becomes a memory. choose the good solitude, the free, wanton, lightsome solitude, which also gives you the right still to remain good in any sense whatsoever how poisonous, how crafty, how bad, does every long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means of force how personal does a long fear make one, a long watching of enemies, of possible enemies these pariahs of society, these long-pursued, badly-persecuted ones also the compulsory recluses, the spinozas or giordano brunos always become in the end, even under the most intellectual masquerade, and perhaps without being themselves aware of it, refined vengeance-seekers and poison-brewers (just lay bare the foundation of spinoza's ethics and theology ), not to speak of the stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing sign in a philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him. the martyrdom of the philosopher, his sacrifice for the sake of truth, forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him; and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity, with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous desire to see him also in his deterioration (deteriorated into a martyr, into a stage-and-tribune-bawler). only, that it is necessary with such a desire to be clear what spectacle one will see in any case merely a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the continued proof that the long, real tragedy is at an end, supposing that every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin. every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy, where he is free from the crowd, the many, the majority where he may forget men who are the rule, as their exception; exclusive only of the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense. whoever, in intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy, gloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes; supposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this burden and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and remains, as i said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then certain: he was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge. for as such, he would one day have to say to himself: the devil take my good taste but 'the rule' is more interesting than the exception than myself, the exception and he would go down, and above all, he would go inside. the long and serious study of the average man and consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad intercourse (all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one's equals): that constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every philosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing part. if he is fortunate, however, as a favourite child of knowledge should be, he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and lighten his task; i mean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize the animal, the commonplace and the rule in themselves, and at the same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them talk of themselves and their like before witnesses sometimes they wallow, even in books, as on their own dung-hill. cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before him, or the scientific satyr speaks out. there are even cases where enchantment mixes with the disgust namely, where by a freak of nature, genius is bound to some such indiscreet billy-goat and ape, as in the case of the abbe galiani, the profoundest, acutest, and perhaps also filthiest man of his century he was far profounder than voltaire, and consequently also, a good deal more silent. it happens more frequently, as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an ape's body, a fine exceptional understanding in a base soul, an occurrence by no means rare, especially among doctors and moral physiologists. and whenever anyone speaks without bitterness, or rather quite innocently, of man as a belly with two requirements, and a head with one; whenever any one sees, seeks, and wants to see only hunger, sexual instinct, and vanity as the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when any one speaks badly and not even ill of man, then ought the lover of knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he ought, in general, to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation. for the indignant man, and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, god, or society), may indeed, morally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and self-satisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more ordinary, more indifferent, and less instructive case. and no one is such a liar as the indignant man. it is difficult to be understood, especially when one thinks and lives gangasrotogati [footnote: like the river ganges: presto.] among those only who think and live otherwise namely, kurmagati [footnote: like the tortoise: lento.], or at best froglike, mandeikagati [footnote: like the frog: staccato.] (i do everything to be difficultly understood myself ) and one should be heartily grateful for the good will to some refinement of interpretation. as regards the good friends, however, who are always too easy-going, and think that as friends they have a right to ease, one does well at the very first to grant them a play-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding one can thus laugh still; or get rid of them altogether, these good friends and laugh then also what is most difficult to render from one language into another is the tempo of its style, which has its basis in the character of the race, or to speak more physiologically, in the average tempo of the assimilation of its nutriment. there are honestly meant translations, which, as involuntary vulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the original, merely because its lively and merry tempo (which overleaps and obviates all dangers in word and expression) could not also be rendered. a german is almost incapacitated for presto in his language; consequently also, as may be reasonably inferred, for many of the most delightful and daring nuances of free, free-spirited thought. and just as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience, so aristophanes and petronius are untranslatable for him. everything ponderous, viscous, and pompously clumsy, all long-winded and wearying species of style, are developed in profuse variety among germans pardon me for stating the fact that even goethe's prose, in its mixture of stiffness and elegance, is no exception, as a reflection of the good old time to which it belongs, and as an expression of german taste at a time when there was still a german taste, which was a rococo-taste in moribus et artibus. lessing is an exception, owing to his histrionic nature, which understood much, and was versed in many things; he who was not the translator of bayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in the shadow of diderot and voltaire, and still more willingly among the roman comedy-writers lessing loved also free-spiritism in the tempo, and flight out of germany. but how could the german language, even in the prose of lessing, imitate the tempo of machiavelli, who in his principe makes us breathe the dry, fine air of florence, and cannot help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo, perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he ventures to present long, heavy, difficult, dangerous thoughts, and a tempo of the gallop, and of the best, wantonest humour finally, who would venture on a german translation of petronius, who, more than any great musician hitherto, was a master of presto in invention, ideas, and words what matter in the end about the swamps of the sick, evil world, or of the ancient world, when like him, one has the feet of a wind, the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a wind, which makes everything healthy, by making everything run and with regard to aristophanes that transfiguring, complementary genius, for whose sake one pardons all hellenism for having existed, provided one has understood in its full profundity all that there requires pardon and transfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on plato's secrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit fait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no bible, nor anything egyptian, pythagorean, or platonic but a book of aristophanes. how could even plato have endured life a greek life which he repudiated without an aristophanes it is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a privilege of the strong. and whoever attempts it, even with the best right, but without being obliged to do so, proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. he enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. supposing such a one comes to grief, it is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor sympathize with it. and he cannot any longer go back he cannot even go back again to the sympathy of men our deepest insights must and should appear as follies, and under certain circumstances as crimes, when they come unauthorizedly to the ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them. the exoteric and the esoteric, as they were formerly distinguished by philosophers among the indians, as among the greeks, persians, and mussulmans, in short, wherever people believed in gradations of rank and not in equality and equal rights are not so much in contradistinction to one another in respect to the exoteric class, standing without, and viewing, estimating, measuring, and judging from the outside, and not from the inside; the more essential distinction is that the class in question views things from below upwards while the esoteric class views things from above downwards. there are heights of the soul from which tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically; and if all the woe in the world were taken together, who would dare to decide whether the sight of it would necessarily seduce and constrain to sympathy, and thus to a doubling of the woe ... that which serves the higher class of men for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an entirely different and lower order of human beings. the virtues of the common man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might be possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate and go to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which he would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he had sunk. there are books which have an inverse value for the soul and the health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality, or the higher and more powerful, make use of them. in the former case they are dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter case they are herald-calls which summon the bravest to their bravery. books for the general reader are always ill-smelling books, the odour of paltry people clings to them. where the populace eat and drink, and even where they reverence, it is accustomed to stink. one should not go into churches if one wishes to breathe pure air. in our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art of nuance, which is the best gain of life, and we have rightly to do hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with yea and nay. everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes, the taste for the unconditional, is cruelly befooled and abused, until a man learns to introduce a little art into his sentiments, and prefers to try conclusions with the artificial, as do the real artists of life. the angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no peace, until it has suitably falsified men and things, to be able to vent its passion upon them: youth in itself even, is something falsifying and deceptive. later on, when the young soul, tortured by continual disillusions, finally turns suspiciously against itself still ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience: how it upbraids itself, how impatiently it tears itself, how it revenges itself for its long self-blinding, as though it had been a voluntary blindness in this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one's sentiments; one tortures one's enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the good conscience to be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and lassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all, one espouses upon principle the cause against youth. a decade later, and one comprehends that all this was also still youth throughout the longest period of human history one calls it the prehistoric period the value or non-value of an action was inferred from its consequences; the action in itself was not taken into consideration, any more than its origin; but pretty much as in china at present, where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to its parents, the retro-operating power of success or failure was what induced men to think well or ill of an action. let us call this period the pre-moral period of mankind; the imperative, know thyself was then still unknown. in the last ten thousand years, on the other hand, on certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far, that one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin, decide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an important refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in origin, the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as the moral one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is thereby made. instead of the consequences, the origin what an inversion of perspective and assuredly an inversion effected only after long struggle and wavering to be sure, an ominous new superstition, a peculiar narrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy precisely thereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite sense possible, as origin out of an intention; people were agreed in the belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention. the intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action: under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been bestowed, and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the present day. is it not possible, however, that the necessity may now have arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing and fundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness and acuteness in man is it not possible that we may be standing on the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be distinguished negatively as ultra-moral: nowadays when, at least among us immoralists, the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely in that which is not intentional, and that all its intentionalness, all that is seen, sensible, or sensed in it, belongs to its surface or skin which, like every skin, betrays something, but conceals still more in short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom, which first requires an explanation a sign, moreover, which has too many interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning in itself alone: that morality, in the sense in which it has been understood hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a prejudice, perhaps a prematureness or preliminariness, probably something of the same rank as astrology and alchemy, but in any case something which must be surmounted. the surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even the self-mounting of morality let that be the name for the long-secret labour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright, and also the most wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones of the soul. it cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice for one's neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, must be mercilessly called to account, and brought to judgment; just as the aesthetics of disinterested contemplation, under which the emasculation of art nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience. there is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments for others and not for myself, for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here, and for one asking promptly: are they not perhaps deceptions that they please him who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and also the mere spectator that is still no argument in their favour, but just calls for caution. let us therefore be cautious at whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays, seen from every position, the erroneousness of the world in which we think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light upon: we find proof after proof thereof, which would fain allure us into surmises concerning a deceptive principle in the nature of things. he, however, who makes thinking itself, and consequently the spirit, responsible for the falseness of the world an honourable exit, which every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of he who regards this world, including space, time, form, and movement, as falsely deduced, would have at least good reason in the end to become distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing upon us the worst of scurvy tricks and what guarantee would it give that it would not continue to do what it has always been doing in all seriousness, the innocence of thinkers has something touching and respect-inspiring in it, which even nowadays permits them to wait upon consciousness with the request that it will give them honest answers: for example, whether it be real or not, and why it keeps the outer world so resolutely at a distance, and other questions of the same description. the belief in immediate certainties is a moral naivete which does honour to us philosophers; but we have now to cease being merely moral men apart from morality, such belief is a folly which does little honour to us if in middle-class life an ever-ready distrust is regarded as the sign of a bad character, and consequently as an imprudence, here among us, beyond the middle-class world and its yeas and nays, what should prevent our being imprudent and saying: the philosopher has at length a right to bad character, as the being who has hitherto been most befooled on earth he is now under obligation to distrustfulness, to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of suspicion. forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of expression; for i myself have long ago learned to think and estimate differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and i keep at least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which philosophers struggle against being deceived. why not it is nothing more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the world. so much must be conceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basis of perspective estimates and semblances; and if, with the virtuous enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers, one wished to do away altogether with the seeming world well, granted that you could do that, at least nothing of your truth would thereby remain indeed, what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an essential opposition of true and false is it not enough to suppose degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker shades and tones of semblance different valeurs, as the painters say why might not the world which concerns us be a fiction and to any one who suggested: but to a fiction belongs an originator might it not be bluntly replied: why may not this belong also belong to the fiction is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the subject, just as towards the predicate and object might not the philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar all respect to governesses, but is it not time that philosophy should renounce governess-faith o voltaire o humanity o idiocy there is something ticklish in the truth, and in the search for the truth; and if man goes about it too humanely il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien i wager he finds nothing supposing that nothing else is given as real but our world of desires and passions, that we cannot sink or rise to any other reality but just that of our impulses for thinking is only a relation of these impulses to one another: are we not permitted to make the attempt and to ask the question whether this which is given does not suffice, by means of our counterparts, for the understanding even of the so-called mechanical (or material) world i do not mean as an illusion, a semblance, a representation (in the berkeleyan and schopenhauerian sense), but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions themselves as a more primitive form of the world of emotions, in which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity, which afterwards branches off and develops itself in organic processes (naturally also, refines and debilitates) as a kind of instinctive life in which all organic functions, including self-regulation, assimilation, nutrition, secretion, and change of matter, are still synthetically united with one another as a primary form of life in the end, it is not only permitted to make this attempt, it is commanded by the conscience of logical method. not to assume several kinds of causality, so long as the attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its furthest extent (to absurdity, if i may be allowed to say so): that is a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays it follows from its definition, as mathematicians say. the question is ultimately whether we really recognize the will as operating, whether we believe in the causality of the will; if we do so and fundamentally our belief in this is just our belief in causality itself we must make the attempt to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality. will can naturally only operate on will and not on matter (not on nerves, for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be hazarded, whether will does not operate on will wherever effects are recognized and whether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power operates therein, is not just the power of will, the effect of will. granted, finally, that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of will namely, the will to power, as my thesis puts it; granted that all organic functions could be traced back to this will to power, and that the solution of the problem of generation and nutrition it is one problem could also be found therein: one would thus have acquired the right to define all active force unequivocally as will to power. the world seen from within, the world defined and designated according to its intelligible character it would simply be will to power, and nothing else. what does not that mean in popular language: god is disproved, but not the devil on the contrary on the contrary, my friends and who the devil also compels you to speak popularly as happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times with the french revolution (that terrible farce, quite superfluous when judged close at hand, into which, however, the noble and visionary spectators of all europe have interpreted from a distance their own indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately, until the text has disappeared under the interpretation), so a noble posterity might once more misunderstand the whole of the past, and perhaps only thereby make its aspect endurable. or rather, has not this already happened have not we ourselves been that noble posterity and, in so far as we now comprehend this, is it not thereby already past nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely because it makes people happy or virtuous excepting, perhaps, the amiable idealists, who are enthusiastic about the good, true, and beautiful, and let all kinds of motley, coarse, and good-natured desirabilities swim about promiscuously in their pond. happiness and virtue are no arguments. it is willingly forgotten, however, even on the part of thoughtful minds, that to make unhappy and to make bad are just as little counter-arguments. a thing could be true, although it were in the highest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full knowledge of it so that the strength of a mind might be measured by the amount of truth it could endure or to speak more plainly, by the extent to which it required truth attenuated, veiled, sweetened, damped, and falsified. but there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain portions of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably situated and have a greater likelihood of success; not to speak of the wicked who are happy a species about whom moralists are silent. perhaps severity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development of strong, independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle, refined, yielding good-nature, and habit of taking things easily, which are prized, and rightly prized in a learned man. presupposing always, to begin with, that the term philosopher be not confined to the philosopher who writes books, or even introduces his philosophy into books stendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the free-spirited philosopher, which for the sake of german taste i will not omit to underline for it is opposed to german taste. pour etre bon philosophe, says this last great psychologist, il faut etre sec, clair, sans illusion. un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie, c'est-a-dire pour voir clair dans ce qui est. everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest things have a hatred even of figure and likeness. should not the contrary only be the right disguise for the shame of a god to go about in a question worth asking it would be strange if some mystic has not already ventured on the same kind of thing. there are proceedings of such a delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness and make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and of an extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take a stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures his recollection. many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret: shame is inventive. they are not the worst things of which one is most ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask there is so much goodness in craft. i could imagine that a man with something costly and fragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his shame requiring it to be so. a man who has depths in his shame meets his destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach, and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate friends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their eyes, and equally so his regained security. such a hidden nature, which instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is inexhaustible in evasion of communication, desires and insists that a mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his friends; and supposing he does not desire it, his eyes will some day be opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there and that it is well to be so. every profound spirit needs a mask; nay, more, around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask, owing to the constantly false, that is to say, superficial interpretation of every word he utters, every step he takes, every sign of life he manifests. one must subject oneself to one's own tests that one is destined for independence and command, and do so at the right time. one must not avoid one's tests, although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous game one can play, and are in the end tests made only before ourselves and before no other judge. not to cleave to any person, be it even the dearest every person is a prison and also a recess. not to cleave to a fatherland, be it even the most suffering and necessitous it is even less difficult to detach one's heart from a victorious fatherland. not to cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher men, into whose peculiar torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight. not to cleave to a science, though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries, apparently specially reserved for us. not to cleave to one's own liberation, to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird, which always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it the danger of the flier. not to cleave to our own virtues, nor become as a whole a victim to any of our specialties, to our hospitality for instance, which is the danger of dangers for highly developed and wealthy souls, who deal prodigally, almost indifferently with themselves, and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes a vice. one must know how to conserve oneself the best test of independence. a new order of philosophers is appearing; i shall venture to baptize them by a name not without danger. as far as i understand them, as far as they allow themselves to be understood for it is their nature to wish to remain something of a puzzle these philosophers of the future might rightly, perhaps also wrongly, claim to be designated as tempters. this name itself is after all only an attempt, or, if it be preferred, a temptation. will they be new friends of truth, these coming philosophers very probably, for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths. but assuredly they will not be dogmatists. it must be contrary to their pride, and also contrary to their taste, that their truth should still be truth for every one that which has hitherto been the secret wish and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts. my opinion is my opinion: another person has not easily a right to it such a philosopher of the future will say, perhaps. one must renounce the bad taste of wishing to agree with many people. good is no longer good when one's neighbour takes it into his mouth. and how could there be a common good the expression contradicts itself; that which can be common is always of small value. in the end things must be as they are and have always been the great things remain for the great, the abysses for the profound, the delicacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up shortly, everything rare for the rare. need i say expressly after all this that they will be free, very free spirits, these philosophers of the future as certainly also they will not be merely free spirits, but something more, higher, greater, and fundamentally different, which does not wish to be misunderstood and mistaken but while i say this, i feel under obligation almost as much to them as to ourselves (we free spirits who are their heralds and forerunners), to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old prejudice and misunderstanding, which, like a fog, has too long made the conception of free spirit obscure. in every country of europe, and the same in america, there is at present something which makes an abuse of this name a very narrow, prepossessed, enchained class of spirits, who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts prompt not to mention that in respect to the new philosophers who are appearing, they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors. briefly and regrettably, they belong to the levellers, these wrongly named free spirits as glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves of the democratic taste and its modern ideas all of them men without solitude, without personal solitude, blunt honest fellows to whom neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied, only, they are not free, and are ludicrously superficial, especially in their innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost all human misery and failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed a notion which happily inverts the truth entirely what they would fain attain with all their strength, is the universal, green-meadow happiness of the herd, together with security, safety, comfort, and alleviation of life for every one, their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines are called equality of rights and sympathy with all sufferers and suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be done away with. we opposite ones, however, who have opened our eye and conscience to the question how and where the plant man has hitherto grown most vigorously, believe that this has always taken place under the opposite conditions, that for this end the dangerousness of his situation had to be increased enormously, his inventive faculty and dissembling power (his spirit) had to develop into subtlety and daring under long oppression and compulsion, and his will to life had to be increased to the unconditioned will to power we believe that severity, violence, slavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy, stoicism, tempter's art and devilry of every kind, that everything wicked, terrible, tyrannical, predatory, and serpentine in man, serves as well for the elevation of the human species as its opposite we do not even say enough when we only say this much, and in any case we find ourselves here, both with our speech and our silence, at the other extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability, as their antipodes perhaps what wonder that we free spirits are not exactly the most communicative spirits that we do not wish to betray in every respect what a spirit can free itself from, and where perhaps it will then be driven and as to the import of the dangerous formula, beyond good and evil, with which we at least avoid confusion, we are something else than libres-penseurs, liben pensatori free-thinkers, and whatever these honest advocates of modern ideas like to call themselves. having been at home, or at least guests, in many realms of the spirit, having escaped again and again from the gloomy, agreeable nooks in which preferences and prejudices, youth, origin, the accident of men and books, or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us, full of malice against the seductions of dependency which he concealed in honours, money, positions, or exaltation of the senses, grateful even for distress and the vicissitudes of illness, because they always free us from some rule, and its prejudice, grateful to the god, devil, sheep, and worm in us, inquisitive to a fault, investigators to the point of cruelty, with unhesitating fingers for the intangible, with teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible, ready for any business that requires sagacity and acute senses, ready for every adventure, owing to an excess of free will, with anterior and posterior souls, into the ultimate intentions of which it is difficult to pry, with foregrounds and backgrounds to the end of which no foot may run, hidden ones under the mantles of light, appropriators, although we resemble heirs and spendthrifts, arrangers and collectors from morning till night, misers of our wealth and our full-crammed drawers, economical in learning and forgetting, inventive in scheming, sometimes proud of tables of categories, sometimes pedants, sometimes night-owls of work even in full day, yea, if necessary, even scarecrows and it is necessary nowadays, that is to say, inasmuch as we are the born, sworn, jealous friends of solitude, of our own profoundest midnight and midday solitude such kind of men are we, we free spirits and perhaps ye are also something of the same kind, ye coming ones ye new philosophers chapter iii. the religious mood the human soul and its limits, the range of man's inner experiences hitherto attained, the heights, depths, and distances of these experiences, the entire history of the soul up to the present time, and its still unexhausted possibilities: this is the preordained hunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover of a big hunt. but how often must he say despairingly to himself: a single individual alas, only a single individual and this great forest, this virgin forest so he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistants, and fine trained hounds, that he could send into the history of the human soul, to drive his game together. in vain: again and again he experiences, profoundly and bitterly, how difficult it is to find assistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite his curiosity. the evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous hunting-domains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in every sense are required, is that they are no longer serviceable just when the big hunt, and also the great danger commences, it is precisely then that they lose their keen eye and nose. in order, for instance, to divine and determine what sort of history the problem of knowledge and conscience has hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi, a person would perhaps himself have to possess as profound, as bruised, as immense an experience as the intellectual conscience of pascal; and then he would still require that wide-spread heaven of clear, wicked spirituality, which, from above, would be able to oversee, arrange, and effectively formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences. but who could do me this service and who would have time to wait for such servants they evidently appear too rarely, they are so improbable at all times eventually one must do everything oneself in order to know something; which means that one has much to do but a curiosity like mine is once for all the most agreeable of vices pardon me i mean to say that the love of truth has its reward in heaven, and already upon earth. faith, such as early christianity desired, and not infrequently achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free-spirited world, which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind it and in it, counting besides the education in tolerance which the imperium romanum gave this faith is not that sincere, austere slave-faith by which perhaps a luther or a cromwell, or some other northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his god and christianity, it is much rather the faith of pascal, which resembles in a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reason a tough, long-lived, worm-like reason, which is not to be slain at once and with a single blow. the christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the sacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit, it is at the same time subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation. there is cruelty and religious phoenicianism in this faith, which is adapted to a tender, many-sided, and very fastidious conscience, it takes for granted that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably painful, that all the past and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum, in the form of which faith comes to it. modern men, with their obtuseness as regards all christian nomenclature, have no longer the sense for the terribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by the paradox of the formula, god on the cross. hitherto there had never and nowhere been such boldness in inversion, nor anything at once so dreadful, questioning, and questionable as this formula: it promised a transvaluation of all ancient values it was the orient, the profound orient, it was the oriental slave who thus took revenge on rome and its noble, light-minded toleration, on the roman catholicism of non-faith, and it was always not the faith, but the freedom from the faith, the half-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith, which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against them. enlightenment causes revolt, for the slave desires the unconditioned, he understands nothing but the tyrannous, even in morals, he loves as he hates, without nuance, to the very depths, to the point of pain, to the point of sickness his many hidden sufferings make him revolt against the noble taste which seems to deny suffering. the skepticism with regard to suffering, fundamentally only an attitude of aristocratic morality, was not the least of the causes, also, of the last great slave-insurrection which began with the french revolution. wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far, we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen: solitude, fasting, and sexual abstinence but without its being possible to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect, or if any relation at all of cause and effect exists there. this latter doubt is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among savage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden and excessive sensuality, which then with equal suddenness transforms into penitential paroxysms, world-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy but nowhere is it more obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other type seems to have been more interesting to men and even to philosophers perhaps it is time to become just a little indifferent here, to learn caution, or, better still, to look away, to go away yet in the background of the most recent philosophy, that of schopenhauer, we find almost as the problem in itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious crisis and awakening. how is the negation of will possible how is the saint possible that seems to have been the very question with which schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher. and thus it was a genuine schopenhauerian consequence, that his most convinced adherent (perhaps also his last, as far as germany is concerned), namely, richard wagner, should bring his own life-work to an end just here, and should finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as kundry, type vecu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that the mad-doctors in almost all european countries had an opportunity to study the type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosis or as i call it, the religious mood made its latest epidemical outbreak and display as the salvation army if it be a question, however, as to what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages, and even to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint, it is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein namely, the immediate succession of opposites, of states of the soul regarded as morally antithetical: it was believed here to be self-evident that a bad man was all at once turned into a saint, a good man. the hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point, is it not possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed itself under the dominion of morals, because it believed in oppositions of moral values, and saw, read, and interpreted these oppositions into the text and facts of the case what miracle only an error of interpretation a lack of philology it seems that the latin races are far more deeply attached to their catholicism than we northerners are to christianity generally, and that consequently unbelief in catholic countries means something quite different from what it does among protestants namely, a sort of revolt against the spirit of the race, while with us it is rather a return to the spirit (or non-spirit) of the race. we northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races, even as regards our talents for religion we have poor talents for it. one may make an exception in the case of the celts, who have theretofore furnished also the best soil for christian infection in the north: the christian ideal blossomed forth in france as much as ever the pale sun of the north would allow it. how strangely pious for our taste are still these later french skeptics, whenever there is any celtic blood in their origin how catholic, how un-german does auguste comte's sociology seem to us, with the roman logic of its instincts how jesuitical, that amiable and shrewd cicerone of port royal, sainte-beuve, in spite of all his hostility to jesuits and even ernest renan: how inaccessible to us northerners does the language of such a renan appear, in whom every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refined voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance let us repeat after him these fine sentences and what wickedness and haughtiness is immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful but harder souls, that is to say, in our more german souls disons donc hardiment que la religion est un produit de l'homme normal, que l'homme est le plus dans le vrai quant il est le plus religieux et le plus assure d'une destinee infinie.... c'est quand il est bon qu'il veut que la virtu corresponde a un order eternal, c'est quand il contemple les choses d'une maniere desinteressee qu'il trouve la mort revoltante et absurde. comment ne pas supposer que c'est dans ces moments-la, que l'homme voit le mieux ... these sentences are so extremely antipodal to my ears and habits of thought, that in my first impulse of rage on finding them, i wrote on the margin, la niaiserie religieuse par excellence until in my later rage i even took a fancy to them, these sentences with their truth absolutely inverted it is so nice and such a distinction to have one's own antipodes that which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancient greeks is the irrestrainable stream of gratitude which it pours forth it is a very superior kind of man who takes such an attitude towards nature and life. later on, when the populace got the upper hand in greece, fear became rampant also in religion; and christianity was preparing itself. the passion for god: there are churlish, honest-hearted, and importunate kinds of it, like that of luther the whole of protestantism lacks the southern delicatezza. there is an oriental exaltation of the mind in it, like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as in the case of st. augustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive manner, all nobility in bearing and desires. there is a feminine tenderness and sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs for a unio mystica et physica, as in the case of madame de guyon. in many cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a girl's or youth's puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid, also as her last ambition. the church has frequently canonized the woman in such a case. the mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before the saint, as the enigma of self-subjugation and utter voluntary privation why did they thus bow they divined in him and as it were behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance the superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation; the strength of will, in which they recognized their own strength and love of power, and knew how to honour it: they honoured something in themselves when they honoured the saint. in addition to this, the contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion: such an enormity of self-negation and anti-naturalness will not have been coveted for nothing they have said, inquiringly. there is perhaps a reason for it, some very great danger, about which the ascetic might wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and visitors in a word, the mighty ones of the world learned to have a new fear before him, they divined a new power, a strange, still unconquered enemy: it was the will to power which obliged them to halt before the saint. they had to question him. in the jewish old testament, the book of divine justice, there are men, things, and sayings on such an immense scale, that greek and indian literature has nothing to compare with it. one stands with fear and reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly, and one has sad thoughts about old asia and its little out-pushed peninsula europe, which would like, by all means, to figure before asia as the progress of mankind. to be sure, he who is himself only a slender, tame house-animal, and knows only the wants of a house-animal (like our cultured people of today, including the christians of cultured christianity), need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins the taste for the old testament is a touchstone with respect to great and small: perhaps he will find that the new testament, the book of grace, still appeals more to his heart (there is much of the odour of the genuine, tender, stupid beadsman and petty soul in it). to have bound up this new testament (a kind of rococo of taste in every respect) along with the old testament into one book, as the bible, as the book in itself, is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the spirit which literary europe has upon its conscience. why atheism nowadays the father in god is thoroughly refuted; equally so the judge, the rewarder. also his free will: he does not hear and even if he did, he would not know how to help. the worst is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly; is he uncertain this is what i have made out (by questioning and listening at a variety of conversations) to be the cause of the decline of european theism; it appears to me that though the religious instinct is in vigorous growth, it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound distrust. what does all modern philosophy mainly do since descartes and indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure an attentat has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old conception of the soul, under the guise of a criticism of the subject and predicate conception that is to say, an attentat on the fundamental presupposition of christian doctrine. modern philosophy, as epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly anti-christian, although (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious. formerly, in effect, one believed in the soul as one believed in grammar and the grammatical subject: one said, i is the condition, think is the predicate and is conditioned to think is an activity for which one must suppose a subject as cause. the attempt was then made, with marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not get out of this net, to see if the opposite was not perhaps true: think the condition, and i the conditioned; i, therefore, only a synthesis which has been made by thinking itself. kant really wished to prove that, starting from the subject, the subject could not be proved nor the object either: the possibility of an apparent existence of the subject, and therefore of the soul, may not always have been strange to him, the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the vedanta philosophy. there is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many rounds; but three of these are the most important. once on a time men sacrificed human beings to their god, and perhaps just those they loved the best to this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive religions, and also the sacrifice of the emperor tiberius in the mithra-grotto on the island of capri, that most terrible of all roman anachronisms. then, during the moral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed to their god the strongest instincts they possessed, their nature; this festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and anti-natural fanatics. finally, what still remained to be sacrificed was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in future blessedness and justice was it not necessary to sacrifice god himself, and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone, stupidity, gravity, fate, nothingness to sacrifice god for nothingness this paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the rising generation; we all know something thereof already. whoever, like myself, prompted by some enigmatical desire, has long endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it from the half-christian, half-german narrowness and stupidity in which it has finally presented itself to this century, namely, in the form of schopenhauer's philosophy; whoever, with an asiatic and super-asiatic eye, has actually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of all possible modes of thought beyond good and evil, and no longer like buddha and schopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of morality, whoever has done this, has perhaps just thereby, without really desiring it, opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal: the ideal of the most world-approving, exuberant, and vivacious man, who has not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and is, but wishes to have it again as it was and is, for all eternity, insatiably calling out da capo, not only to himself, but to the whole piece and play; and not only the play, but actually to him who requires the play and makes it necessary; because he always requires himself anew and makes himself necessary. what and this would not be circulus vitiosus deus the distance, and as it were the space around man, grows with the strength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world becomes profounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever coming into view. perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised its acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise, something of a game, something for children and childish minds. perhaps the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting and suffering, the conceptions god and sin, will one day seem to us of no more importance than a child's plaything or a child's pain seems to an old man; and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then be necessary once more for the old man always childish enough, an eternal child has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or semi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for its favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its soft placidity called prayer, the state of perpetual readiness for the coming of god), i mean the idleness with a good conscience, the idleness of olden times and of blood, to which the aristocratic sentiment that work is dishonouring that it vulgarizes body and soul is not quite unfamiliar and that consequently the modern, noisy, time-engrossing, conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates and prepares for unbelief more than anything else among these, for instance, who are at present living apart from religion in germany, i find free-thinkers of diversified species and origin, but above all a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know what purpose religions serve, and only note their existence in the world with a kind of dull astonishment. they feel themselves already fully occupied, these good people, be it by their business or by their pleasures, not to mention the fatherland, and the newspapers, and their family duties; it seems that they have no time whatever left for religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a question of a new business or a new pleasure for it is impossible, they say to themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil their tempers. they are by no means enemies of religious customs; should certain circumstances, state affairs perhaps, require their participation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many things are done with a patient and unassuming seriousness, and without much curiosity or discomfort; they live too much apart and outside to feel even the necessity for a for or against in such matters. among those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of german protestants of the middle classes, especially in the great laborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious scholars, and the entire university personnel (with the exception of the theologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). on the part of pious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea of how much good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a german scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his whole profession (and as i have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to which he is compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the uncleanliness of spirit which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong to the church. it is only with the help of history (not through his own personal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing himself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference in presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached the stage of gratitude towards them, he has not personally advanced one step nearer to that which still maintains itself as church or as piety; perhaps even the contrary. the practical indifference to religious matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up, usually sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness, which shuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just the depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it. every age has its own divine type of naivete, for the discovery of which other ages may envy it: and how much naivete adorable, childlike, and boundlessly foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in his superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the religious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and above which he himself has developed he, the little arrogant dwarf and mob-man, the sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of ideas, of modern ideas whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. it is their preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty, lightsome, and false. here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration of pure forms in philosophers as well as in artists: it is not to be doubted that whoever has need of the cult of the superficial to that extent, has at one time or another made an unlucky dive beneath it. perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt children, the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying to falsify its image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might guess to what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which they wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and deified, one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists, as their highest rank. it is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a religious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which divines that truth might be attained too soon, before man has become strong enough, hard enough, artist enough.... piety, the life in god, regarded in this light, would appear as the most elaborate and ultimate product of the fear of truth, as artist-adoration and artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of all falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at any price. perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means of beautifying man than piety, by means of it man can become so artful, so superficial, so iridescent, and so good, that his appearance no longer offends. to love mankind for god's sake this has so far been the noblest and remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained. that love to mankind, without any redeeming intention in the background, is only an additional folly and brutishness, that the inclination to this love has first to get its proportion, its delicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling of ambergris from a higher inclination whoever first perceived and experienced this, however his tongue may have stammered as it attempted to express such a delicate matter, let him for all time be holy and respected, as the man who has so far flown highest and gone astray in the finest fashion the philosopher, as we free spirits understand him as the man of the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the general development of mankind, will use religion for his disciplining and educating work, just as he will use the contemporary political and economic conditions. the selecting and disciplining influence destructive, as well as creative and fashioning which can be exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to the sort of people placed under its spell and protection. for those who are strong and independent, destined and trained to command, in whom the judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of authority as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common, betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter, their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience. and in the case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of superior spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative life, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government (over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion itself may be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of managing grosser affairs, and for securing immunity from the unavoidable filth of all political agitation. the brahmins, for instance, understood this fact. with the help of a religious organization, they secured to themselves the power of nominating kings for the people, while their sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside, as men with a higher and super-regal mission. at the same time religion gives inducement and opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which, through fortunate marriage customs, volitional power and delight in self-control are on the increase. to them religion offers sufficient incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and to experience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and of solitude. asceticism and puritanism are almost indispensable means of educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. and finally, to ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and general utility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart, ennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy, with something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of justification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all the semi-animal poverty of their souls. religion, together with the religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually harassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it operates upon them as the epicurean philosophy usually operates upon sufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner, almost turning suffering to account, and in the end even hallowing and vindicating it. there is perhaps nothing so admirable in christianity and buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it difficult enough to live this very difficulty being necessary. to be sure to make also the bad counter-reckoning against such religions, and to bring to light their secret dangers the cost is always excessive and terrible when religions do not operate as an educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher, but rule voluntarily and paramountly, when they wish to be the final end, and not a means along with other means. among men, as among all other animals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating, infirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful cases, among men also, are always the exception; and in view of the fact that man is the animal not yet properly adapted to his environment, the rare exception. but worse still. the higher the type a man represents, the greater is the improbability that he will succeed; the accidental, the law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind, manifests itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of men, the conditions of whose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult to determine. what, then, is the attitude of the two greatest religions above-mentioned to the surplus of failures in life they endeavour to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the religions for sufferers, they take the part of these upon principle; they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a disease, and they would fain treat every other experience of life as false and impossible. however highly we may esteem this indulgent and preservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied, and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of man), the hitherto paramount religions to give a general appreciation of them are among the principal causes which have kept the type of man upon a lower level they have preserved too much that which should have perished. one has to thank them for invaluable services; and who is sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that the spiritual men of christianity have done for europe hitherto but when they had given comfort to the sufferers, courage to the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to the helpless, and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual penitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had they to do in order to work systematically in that fashion, and with a good conscience, for the preservation of all the sick and suffering, which means, in deed and in truth, to work for the deterioration of the european race to reverse all estimates of value that is what they had to do and to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast suspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything autonomous, manly, conquering, and imperious all instincts which are natural to the highest and most successful type of man into uncertainty, distress of conscience, and self-destruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy over the earth, into hatred of the earth and earthly things that is the task the church imposed on itself, and was obliged to impose, until, according to its standard of value, unworldliness, unsensuousness, and higher man fused into one sentiment. if one could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse and refined comedy of european christianity with the derisive and impartial eye of an epicurean god, i should think one would never cease marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some single will has ruled over europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a sublime abortion of man he, however, who, with opposite requirements (no longer epicurean) and with some divine hammer in his hand, could approach this almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in the european christian (pascal, for instance), would he not have to cry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: oh, you bunglers, presumptuous pitiful bunglers, what have you done was that a work for your hands how you have hacked and botched my finest stone what have you presumed to do i should say that christianity has hitherto been the most portentous of presumptions. men, not great enough, nor hard enough, to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning man; men, not sufficiently strong and far-sighted to allow, with sublime self-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and perishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from man: such men, with their equality before god, have hitherto swayed the destiny of europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species has been produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly, mediocre, the european of the present day. chapter iv. apophthegms and interludes he who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously and even himself only in relation to his pupils. knowledge for its own sake that is the last snare laid by morality: we are thereby completely entangled in morals once more. the charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has to be overcome on the way to it. we are most dishonourable towards our god: he is not permitted to sin. the tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed, deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a god among men. love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense of all others. love to god also i did that, says my memory. i could not have done that, says my pride, and remains inexorable. eventually the memory yields. one has regarded life carelessly, if one has failed to see the hand that kills with leniency. if a man has character, he has also his typical experience, which always recurs. the sage as astronomer. so long as thou feelest the stars as an above thee, thou lackest the eye of the discerning one. it is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments that makes great men. he who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it. many a peacock hides his tail from every eye and calls it his pride. a man of genius is unbearable, unless he possess at least two things besides: gratitude and purity. the degree and nature of a man's sensuality extends to the highest altitudes of his spirit. under peaceful conditions the militant man attacks himself. with his principles a man seeks either to dominate, or justify, or honour, or reproach, or conceal his habits: two men with the same principles probably seek fundamentally different ends therewith. he who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself thereby, as a despiser. a soul which knows that it is loved, but does not itself love, betrays its sediment: its dregs come up. a thing that is explained ceases to concern us what did the god mean who gave the advice, know thyself did it perhaps imply cease to be concerned about thyself become objective and socrates and the scientific man it is terrible to die of thirst at sea. is it necessary that you should so salt your truth that it will no longer quench thirst sympathy for all would be harshness and tyranny for thee, my good neighbour. instinct when the house is on fire one forgets even the dinner yes, but one recovers it from among the ashes. woman learns how to hate in proportion as she forgets how to charm. the same emotions are in man and woman, but in different tempo, on that account man and woman never cease to misunderstand each other. in the background of all their personal vanity, women themselves have still their impersonal scorn for woman. fettered heart, free spirit when one firmly fetters one's heart and keeps it prisoner, one can allow one's spirit many liberties: i said this once before but people do not believe it when i say so, unless they know it already. one begins to distrust very clever persons when they become embarrassed. dreadful experiences raise the question whether he who experiences them is not something dreadful also. heavy, melancholy men turn lighter, and come temporarily to their surface, precisely by that which makes others heavy by hatred and love. so cold, so icy, that one burns one's finger at the touch of him every hand that lays hold of him shrinks back and for that very reason many think him red-hot. who has not, at one time or another sacrificed himself for the sake of his good name in affability there is no hatred of men, but precisely on that account a great deal too much contempt of men. the maturity of man that means, to have reacquired the seriousness that one had as a child at play. to be ashamed of one's immorality is a step on the ladder at the end of which one is ashamed also of one's morality. one should part from life as ulysses parted from nausicaa blessing it rather than in love with it. what a great man i always see merely the play-actor of his own ideal. when one trains one's conscience, it kisses one while it bites. the disappointed one speaks i listened for the echo and i heard only praise. we all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are, we thus relax ourselves away from our fellows. a discerning one might easily regard himself at present as the animalization of god. discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the lover with regard to the beloved. what she is modest enough to love even you or stupid enough or or - the danger in happiness. everything now turns out best for me, i now love every fate: who would like to be my fate not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love, prevents the christians of today burning us. the pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste (the piety) of the free spirit (the pious man of knowledge) than the impia fraus. hence the profound lack of judgment, in comparison with the church, characteristic of the type free spirit as its non-freedom. by means of music the very passions enjoy themselves. a sign of strong character, when once the resolution has been taken, to shut the ear even to the best counter-arguments. occasionally, therefore, a will to stupidity. there is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral interpretation of phenomena. the criminal is often enough not equal to his deed: he extenuates and maligns it. the advocates of a criminal are seldom artists enough to turn the beautiful terribleness of the deed to the advantage of the doer. our vanity is most difficult to wound just when our pride has been wounded. to him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and not to belief, all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he guards against them. you want to prepossess him in your favour then you must be embarrassed before him. the immense expectation with regard to sexual love, and the coyness in this expectation, spoils all the perspectives of women at the outset. where there is neither love nor hatred in the game, woman's play is mediocre. the great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage to rebaptize our badness as the best in us. the will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will of another, or of several other, emotions. there is an innocence of admiration: it is possessed by him to whom it has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired some day. our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our cleaning ourselves justifying ourselves. sensuality often forces the growth of love too much, so that its root remains weak, and is easily torn up. it is a curious thing that god learned greek when he wished to turn author and that he did not learn it better. to rejoice on account of praise is in many cases merely politeness of heart and the very opposite of vanity of spirit. even concubinage has been corrupted by marriage. he who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but because of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected it. a parable. when we have to change an opinion about any one, we charge heavily to his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us. a nation is a detour of nature to arrive at six or seven great men. yes, and then to get round them. in the eyes of all true women science is hostile to the sense of shame. they feel as if one wished to peep under their skin with it or worse still under their dress and finery. the more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must you allure the senses to it. the devil has the most extensive perspectives for god; on that account he keeps so far away from him: the devil, in effect, as the oldest friend of knowledge. what a person is begins to betray itself when his talent decreases, when he ceases to show what he can do. talent is also an adornment; an adornment is also a concealment. the sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is that in reality they honour and love only themselves (or their own ideal, to express it more agreeably). thus man wishes woman to be peaceable: but in fact woman is essentially unpeaceable, like the cat, however well she may have assumed the peaceable demeanour. one is punished best for one's virtues. he who cannot find the way to his ideal, lives more frivolously and shamelessly than the man without an ideal. from the senses originate all trustworthiness, all good conscience, all evidence of truth. pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man; a considerable part of it is rather an essential condition of being good. the one seeks an accoucheur for his thoughts, the other seeks some one whom he can assist: a good conversation thus originates. in intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very remarkable man. we do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent and imagine him with whom we have intercourse and forget it immediately. in revenge and in love woman is more barbarous than man. advice as a riddle. if the band is not to break, bite it first secure to make the belly is the reason why man does not so readily take himself for a god. the chastest utterance i ever heard: dans le veritable amour c'est l'ame qui enveloppe le corps. our vanity would like what we do best to pass precisely for what is most difficult to us. concerning the origin of many systems of morals. when a woman has scholarly inclinations there is generally something wrong with her sexual nature. barrenness itself conduces to a certain virility of taste; man, indeed, if i may say so, is the barren animal. comparing man and woman generally, one may say that woman would not have the genius for adornment, if she had not the instinct for the secondary role. he who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. and if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee. from old florentine novels moreover, from life: buona femmina e mala femmina vuol bastone. sacchetti, nov. to seduce their neighbour to a favourable opinion, and afterwards to believe implicitly in this opinion of their neighbour who can do this conjuring trick so well as women that which an age considers evil is usually an unseasonable echo of what was formerly considered good the atavism of an old ideal. around the hero everything becomes a tragedy; around the demigod everything becomes a satyr-play; and around god everything becomes what perhaps a world it is not enough to possess a talent: one must also have your permission to possess it; eh, my friends where there is the tree of knowledge, there is always paradise: so say the most ancient and the most modern serpents. what is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil. objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs of health; everything absolute belongs to pathology. the sense of the tragic increases and declines with sensuousness. insanity in individuals is something rare but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule. the thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of it one gets successfully through many a bad night. not only our reason, but also our conscience, truckles to our strongest impulse the tyrant in us. one must repay good and ill; but why just to the person who did us good or ill one no longer loves one's knowledge sufficiently after one has communicated it. poets act shamelessly towards their experiences: they exploit them. our fellow-creature is not our neighbour, but our neighbour's neighbour: so thinks every nation. love brings to light the noble and hidden qualities of a lover his rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive as to his normal character. jesus said to his jews: the law was for servants; love god as i love him, as his son what have we sons of god to do with morals in sight of every party. a shepherd has always need of a bell-wether or he has himself to be a wether occasionally. one may indeed lie with the mouth; but with the accompanying grimace one nevertheless tells the truth. to vigorous men intimacy is a matter of shame and something precious. christianity gave eros poison to drink; he did not die of it, certainly, but degenerated to vice. to talk much about oneself may also be a means of concealing oneself. in praise there is more obtrusiveness than in blame. pity has an almost ludicrous effect on a man of knowledge, like tender hands on a cyclops. one occasionally embraces some one or other, out of love to mankind (because one cannot embrace all); but this is what one must never confess to the individual. one does not hate as long as one disesteems, but only when one esteems equal or superior. ye utilitarians ye, too, love the utile only as a vehicle for your inclinations, ye, too, really find the noise of its wheels insupportable one loves ultimately one's desires, not the thing desired. the vanity of others is only counter to our taste when it is counter to our vanity. with regard to what truthfulness is, perhaps nobody has ever been sufficiently truthful. one does not believe in the follies of clever men: what a forfeiture of the rights of man the consequences of our actions seize us by the forelock, very indifferent to the fact that we have meanwhile reformed. there is an innocence in lying which is the sign of good faith in a cause. it is inhuman to bless when one is being cursed. the familiarity of superiors embitters one, because it may not be returned. i am affected, not because you have deceived me, but because i can no longer believe in you. there is a haughtiness of kindness which has the appearance of wickedness. i dislike him. why i am not a match for him. did any one ever answer so chapter v. the natural history of morals the moral sentiment in europe at present is perhaps as subtle, belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the science of morals belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered: an interesting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious in the very person of a moralist. indeed, the expression, science of morals is, in respect to what is designated thereby, far too presumptuous and counter to good taste, which is always a foretaste of more modest expressions. one ought to avow with the utmost fairness what is still necessary here for a long time, what is alone proper for the present: namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth, and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish and perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common forms of these living crystallizations as preparation for a theory of types of morality. to be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest. all the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness, demanded of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science: they wanted to give a basic to morality and every philosopher hitherto has believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself, however, has been regarded as something given. how far from their awkward pride was the seemingly insignificant problem left in dust and decay of a description of forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands and senses could hardly be fine enough for it it was precisely owing to moral philosophers' knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary epitome, or an accidental abridgement perhaps as the morality of their environment, their position, their church, their zeitgeist, their climate and zone it was precisely because they were badly instructed with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means eager to know about these matters, that they did not even come in sight of the real problems of morals problems which only disclose themselves by a comparison of many kinds of morality. in every science of morals hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself has been omitted: there has been no suspicion that there was anything problematic there that which philosophers called giving a basis to morality, and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light, proved merely a learned form of good faith in prevailing morality, a new means of its expression, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of denial that it is lawful for this morality to be called in question and in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and vivisecting of this very faith. hear, for instance, with what innocence almost worthy of honour schopenhauer represents his own task, and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a science whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and old wives: the principle, he says (pageof the grundprobleme der ethik), [footnote: pages55 of schopenhauer's basis of morality, translated by arthur b. bullock, m.a. .] the axiom about the purport of which all moralists are practically agreed: neminem laede, immo omnes quantum potes juva is really the proposition which all moral teachers strive to establish, ... the real basis of ethics which has been sought, like the philosopher's stone, for centuries. the difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be great it is well known that schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his efforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is will to power, may be reminded that schopenhauer, although a pessimist, actually played the flute... daily after dinner: one may read about the matter in his biography. a question by the way: a pessimist, a repudiator of god and of the world, who makes a halt at morality who assents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what is that really a pessimist apart from the value of such assertions as there is a categorical imperative in us, one can always ask: what does such an assertion indicate about him who makes it there are systems of morals which are meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems of morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied; with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others he wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction, this system of morals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something of him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and creative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, kant especially, gives us to understand by his morals that what is estimable in me, is that i know how to obey and with you it shall not be otherwise than with me in short, systems of morals are only a sign-language of the emotions. in contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of tyranny against nature and also against reason, that is, however, no objection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful what is essential and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a long constraint. in order to understand stoicism, or port royal, or puritanism, one should remember the constraint under which every language has attained to strength and freedom the metrical constraint, the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. how much trouble have the poets and orators of every nation given themselves not excepting some of the prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable conscientiousness for the sake of a folly, as utilitarian bunglers say, and thereby deem themselves wise from submission to arbitrary laws, as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves free, even free-spirited. the singular fact remains, however, that everything of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and masterly certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought itself, or in administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just as in conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary law, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely this is nature and natural and not laisser-aller every artist knows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his most natural condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing, and constructing in the moments of inspiration and how strictly and delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness and precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold, and ambiguous in it). the essential thing in heaven and in earth is, apparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long obedience in the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in the long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance, virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality anything whatever that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine. the long bondage of the spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of ideas, the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think in accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable to aristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret everything that happened according to a christian scheme, and in every occurrence to rediscover and justify the christian god: all this violence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness, has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the european spirit has attained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility; granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be stifled, suffocated, and spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere, nature shows herself as she is, in all her extravagant and indifferent magnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless noble). that for centuries european thinkers only thought in order to prove something nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every thinker who wishes to prove something that it was always settled beforehand what was to be the result of their strictest thinking, as it was perhaps in the asiatic astrology of former times, or as it is still at the present day in the innocent, christian-moral explanation of immediate personal events for the glory of god, or for the good of the soul: this tyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent stupidity, has educated the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and the finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual education and discipline. one may look at every system of morals in this light: it is nature therein which teaches to hate the laisser-aller, the too great freedom, and implants the need for limited horizons, for immediate duties it teaches the narrowing of perspectives, and thus, in a certain sense, that stupidity is a condition of life and development. thou must obey some one, and for a long time; otherwise thou wilt come to grief, and lose all respect for thyself this seems to me to be the moral imperative of nature, which is certainly neither categorical, as old kant wished (consequently the otherwise), nor does it address itself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual ), but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all, however, to the animal man generally, to mankind. industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a master stroke of english instinct to hallow and begloom sunday to such an extent that the englishman unconsciously hankers for his week and work-day again: as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated fast, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although, as is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect to work). many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful influences and habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary days are appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to hunger anew. viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism, seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during which an impulse learns to humble and submit itself at the same time also to purify and sharpen itself; certain philosophical sects likewise admit of a similar interpretation (for instance, the stoa, in the midst of hellenic culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with aphrodisiacal odours). here also is a hint for the explanation of the paradox, why it was precisely in the most christian period of european history, and in general only under the pressure of christian sentiments, that the sexual impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion). there is something in the morality of plato which does not really belong to plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might say, in spite of him: namely, socratism, for which he himself was too noble. no one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done unwittingly. the evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do so, however, if he knew that evil is evil. the evil man, therefore, is only evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarily make him good. this mode of reasoning savours of the populace, who perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically judge that it is stupid to do wrong; while they accept good as identical with useful and pleasant, without further thought. as regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err. plato did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret himself into them he, the most daring of all interpreters, who lifted the entire socrates out of the street, as a popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless and impossible modifications namely, in all his own disguises and multiplicities. in jest, and in homeric language as well, what is the platonic socrates, if not [greek words inserted here.] the old theological problem of faith and knowledge, or more plainly, of instinct and reason the question whether, in respect to the valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than rationality, which wants to appreciate and act according to motives, according to a why, that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utility it is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of socrates, and had divided men's minds long before christianity. socrates himself, following, of course, the taste of his talent that of a surpassing dialectician took first the side of reason; and, in fact, what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the noble athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions in the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also at himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found in himself the same difficulty and incapacity. but why he said to himself should one on that account separate oneself from the instincts one must set them right, and the reason also one must follow the instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support them with good arguments. this was the real falseness of that great and mysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that he was satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived the irrationality in the moral judgment. plato, more innocent in such matters, and without the craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to himself, at the expenditure of all his strength the greatest strength a philosopher had ever expended that reason and instinct lead spontaneously to one goal, to the good, to god; and since plato, all theologians and philosophers have followed the same path which means that in matters of morality, instinct (or as christians call it, faith, or as i call it, the herd) has hitherto triumphed. unless one should make an exception in the case of descartes, the father of rationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the revolution), who recognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool, and descartes was superficial. whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest processes of all knowledge and cognizance: there, as here, the premature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to belief, and the lack of distrust and patience are first developed our senses learn late, and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and cautious organs of knowledge. our eyes find it easier on a given occasion to produce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon the divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more force, more morality. it is difficult and painful for the ear to listen to anything new; we hear strange music badly. when we hear another language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds into words with which we are more familiar and conversant it was thus, for example, that the germans modified the spoken word arcubalista into armbrust (cross-bow). our senses are also hostile and averse to the new; and generally, even in the simplest processes of sensation, the emotions dominate such as fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion of indolence. as little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words (not to speak of syllables) of a page he rather takes about five out of every twenty words at random, and guesses the probably appropriate sense to them just as little do we see a tree correctly and completely in respect to its leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so much easier to fancy the chance of a tree. even in the midst of the most remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the greater part of the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate any event, except as inventors thereof. all this goes to prove that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have been accustomed to lying. or, to express it more politely and hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly one is much more of an artist than one is aware of. in an animated conversation, i often see the face of the person with whom i am speaking so clearly and sharply defined before me, according to the thought he expresses, or which i believe to be evoked in his mind, that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the strength of my visual faculty the delicacy of the play of the muscles and of the expression of the eyes must therefore be imagined by me. probably the person put on quite a different expression, or none at all. quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise. what we experience in dreams, provided we experience it often, pertains at last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything actually experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer, we have a requirement more or less, and finally, in broad daylight, and even in the brightest moments of our waking life, we are ruled to some extent by the nature of our dreams. supposing that someone has often flown in his dreams, and that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his peculiarly enviable happiness; such a person, who believes that on the slightest impulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who knows the sensation of a certain divine levity, an upwards without effort or constraint, a downwards without descending or lowering without trouble how could the man with such dream-experiences and dream-habits fail to find happiness differently coloured and defined, even in his waking hours how could he fail to long differently for happiness flight, such as is described by poets, must, when compared with his own flying, be far too earthly, muscular, violent, far too troublesome for him. the difference among men does not manifest itself only in the difference of their lists of desirable things in their regarding different good things as worth striving for, and being disagreed as to the greater or less value, the order of rank, of the commonly recognized desirable things: it manifests itself much more in what they regard as actually having and possessing a desirable thing. as regards a woman, for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for possession, sees the questionableness, the mere apparentness of such ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for his sake what she has or would like to have only then does he look upon her as possessed. a third, however, has not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether the woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do so for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed, profoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found out. only then does he feel the beloved one fully in his possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality. one man would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts of cagliostro and catalina suitable for his purpose. another, with a more refined thirst for possession, says to himself: one may not deceive where one desires to possess he is irritated and impatient at the idea that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: i must, therefore, make myself known, and first of all learn to know myself among helpful and charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as though, for instance, he should merit help, seek just their help, and would show himself deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them for all help. with these conceits, they take control of the needy as a property, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a desire for property. one finds them jealous when they are crossed or forestalled in their charity. parents involuntarily make something like themselves out of their children they call that education; no mother doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is thereby her property, no father hesitates about his right to his own ideas and notions of worth. indeed, in former times fathers deemed it right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly born (as among the ancient germans). and like the father, so also do the teacher, the class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession. the consequence is... the jews a people born for slavery, as tacitus and the whole ancient world say of them; the chosen people among the nations, as they themselves say and believe the jews performed the miracle of the inversion of valuations, by means of which life on earth obtained a new and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums. their prophets fused into one the expressions rich, godless, wicked, violent, sensual, and for the first time coined the word world as a term of reproach. in this inversion of valuations (in which is also included the use of the word poor as synonymous with saint and friend) the significance of the jewish people is to be found; it is with them that the slave-insurrection in morals commences. it is to be inferred that there are countless dark bodies near the sun such as we shall never see. among ourselves, this is an allegory; and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star-writing merely as an allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed. the beast of prey and the man of prey (for instance, caesar borgia) are fundamentally misunderstood, nature is misunderstood, so long as one seeks a morbidness in the constitution of these healthiest of all tropical monsters and growths, or even an innate hell in them as almost all moralists have done hitherto. does it not seem that there is a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists and that the tropical man must be discredited at all costs, whether as disease and deterioration of mankind, or as his own hell and self-torture and why in favour of the temperate zones in favour of the temperate men the moral the mediocre this for the chapter: morals as timidity. all the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to their happiness, as it is called what else are they but suggestions for behaviour adapted to the degree of danger from themselves in which the individuals live; recipes for their passions, their good and bad propensities, insofar as such have the will to power and would like to play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborations, permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wife wisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in their form because they address themselves to all, because they generalize where generalization is not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally, and taking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merely with one grain of salt, but rather endurable only, and sometimes even seductive, when they are over-spiced and begin to smell dangerously, especially of the other world. that is all of little value when estimated intellectually, and is far from being science, much less wisdom; but, repeated once more, and three times repeated, it is expediency, expediency, expediency, mixed with stupidity, stupidity, stupidity whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness towards the heated folly of the emotions, which the stoics advised and fostered; or the no-more-laughing and no-more-weeping of spinoza, the destruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection, which he recommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent mean at which they may be satisfied, the aristotelianism of morals; or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art, perhaps as music, or as love of god, and of mankind for god's sake for in religion the passions are once more enfranchised, provided that...; or, finally, even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions, as has been taught by hafis and goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of wise old codgers and drunkards, with whom it no longer has much danger. this also for the chapter: morals as timidity. inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed, there have also been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples, states, churches), and always a great number who obey in proportion to the small number who command in view, therefore, of the fact that obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto, one may reasonably suppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is now innate in every one, as a kind of formal conscience which gives the command thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally refrain from something, in short, thou shalt. this need tries to satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content, according to its strength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous appetite with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into its ear by all sorts of commanders parents, teachers, laws, class prejudices, or public opinion. the extraordinary limitation of human development, the hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and turning thereof, is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of obedience is transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. if one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to command just as if they also were only obeying. this condition of things actually exists in europe at present i call it the moral hypocrisy of the commanding class. they know no other way of protecting themselves from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older and higher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of the law, or of god himself), or they even justify themselves by maxims from the current opinions of the herd, as first servants of their people, or instruments of the public weal. on the other hand, the gregarious european man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only kind of man that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as public spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty, indulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and useful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues. in cases, however, where it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative constitutions, for example, are of this origin. in spite of all, what a blessing, what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable, is the appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious europeans of this fact the effect of the appearance of napoleon was the last great proof the history of the influence of napoleon is almost the history of the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its worthiest individuals and periods. the man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with one another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his body that is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts and standards of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom at peace such a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an average, be a weak man. his fundamental desire is that the war which is in him should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine and mode of thought (for instance, epicurean or christian); it is above all things the happiness of repose, of undisturbedness, of repletion, of final unity it is the sabbath of sabbaths, to use the expression of the holy rhetorician, st. augustine, who was himself such a man. should, however, the contrariety and conflict in such natures operate as an additional incentive and stimulus to life and if, on the other hand, in addition to their powerful and irreconcilable instincts, they have also inherited and indoctrinated into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict with themselves (that is to say, the faculty of self-control and self-deception), there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and inexplicable beings, those enigmatical men, predestined for conquering and circumventing others, the finest examples of which are alcibiades and caesar (with whom i should like to associate the first of europeans according to my taste, the hohenstaufen, frederick the second), and among artists, perhaps leonardo da vinci. they appear precisely in the same periods when that weaker type, with its longing for repose, comes to the front; the two types are complementary to each other, and spring from the same causes. as long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be no morality of love to one's neighbour. granted even that there is already a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness, gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly distinguished by honourable names as virtues, and eventually almost coincide with the conception morality: in that period they do not as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations they are still ultra-moral. a sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good nor bad, moral nor immoral, in the best period of the romans; and should it be praised, a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this praise, even at the best, directly the sympathetic action is compared with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the res publica. after all, love to our neighbour is always a secondary matter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to our fear of our neighbour. after the fabric of society seems on the whole established and secured against external dangers, it is this fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral valuation. certain strong and dangerous instincts, such as the love of enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and love of power, which up till then had not only to be honoured from the point of view of general utility under other names, of course, than those here given but had to be fostered and cultivated (because they were perpetually required in the common danger against the common enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong when the outlets for them are lacking and are gradually branded as immoral and given over to calumny. the contrary instincts and inclinations now attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its conclusions. how much or how little dangerousness to the community or to equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a disposition, or an endowment that is now the moral perspective, here again fear is the mother of morals. it is by the loftiest and strongest instincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual far above and beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these very instincts will be most branded and defamed. the lofty independent spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called evil, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing disposition, the mediocrity of desires, attains to moral distinction and honour. finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is always less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, the lamb, and still more the sheep, wins respect. there is a point of diseased mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society itself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the criminal, and does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. to punish, appears to it to be somehow unfair it is certain that the idea of punishment and the obligation to punish are then painful and alarming to people. is it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered harmless why should we still punish punishment itself is terrible with these questions gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate conclusion. if one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear, one would have done away with this morality at the same time, it would no longer be necessary, it would not consider itself any longer necessary whoever examines the conscience of the present-day european, will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds and hidden recesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd we wish that some time or other there may be nothing more to fear some time or other the will and the way thereto is nowadays called progress all over europe. let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred times, for people's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths our truths. we know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one plainly, and without metaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will be accounted to us almost a crime, that it is precisely in respect to men of modern ideas that we have constantly applied the terms herd, herd-instincts, and such like expressions. what avail is it we cannot do otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is. we have found that in all the principal moral judgments, europe has become unanimous, including likewise the countries where european influence prevails in europe people evidently know what socrates thought he did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to teach they know today what is good and evil. it must then sound hard and be distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which here thinks it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise and blame, and calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human animal, the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more to the front, to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts, according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance of which it is the symptom. morality in europe at present is herding-animal morality, and therefore, as we understand the matter, only one kind of human morality, beside which, before which, and after which many other moralities, and above all higher moralities, are or should be possible. against such a possibility, against such a should be, however, this morality defends itself with all its strength, it says obstinately and inexorably i am morality itself and nothing else is morality indeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things have reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of this morality even in political and social arrangements: the democratic movement is the inheritance of the christian movement. that its tempo, however, is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones, for those who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated by the increasingly furious howling, and always less disguised teeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now roving through the highways of european culture. apparently in opposition to the peacefully industrious democrats and revolution-ideologues, and still more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who call themselves socialists and want a free society, those are really at one with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form of society other than that of the autonomous herd (to the extent even of repudiating the notions master and servant ni dieu ni maitre, says a socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every special claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately opposition to every right, for when all are equal, no one needs rights any longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it were a violation of the weak, unfair to the necessary consequences of all former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy, in their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the very animals, up even to god the extravagance of sympathy for god belongs to a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and impatience of their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering generally, in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or allowing it; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening, under the spell of which europe seems to be threatened with a new buddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of mutual sympathy, as though it were morality in itself, the climax, the attained climax of mankind, the sole hope of the future, the consolation of the present, the great discharge from all the obligations of the past; altogether at one in their belief in the community as the deliverer, in the herd, and therefore in themselves. we, who hold a different belief we, who regard the democratic movement, not only as a degenerating form of political organization, but as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type of man, as involving his mediocrising and depreciation: where have we to fix our hopes in new philosophers there is no other alternative: in minds strong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvalue and invert eternal valuations; in forerunners, in men of the future, who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which will compel millenniums to take new paths. to teach man the future of humanity as his will, as depending on human will, and to make preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in rearing and educating, in order thereby to put an end to the frightful rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of history (the folly of the greatest number is only its last form) for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will some time or other be needed, at the very idea of which everything that has existed in the way of occult, terrible, and benevolent beings might look pale and dwarfed. the image of such leaders hovers before our eyes: is it lawful for me to say it aloud, ye free spirits the conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for their genesis; the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a constraint to these tasks; a transvaluation of values, under the new pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of such responsibility; and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders, the dreadful danger that they might be lacking, or miscarry and degenerate: these are our real anxieties and glooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the heaven of our life. there are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined, or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and deteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger of man himself deteriorating, he who like us has recognized the extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in respect to the future of mankind a game in which neither the hand, nor even a finger of god has participated he who divines the fate that is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of modern ideas, and still more under the whole of christo-european morality suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared. he sees at a glance all that could still be made out of man through a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and arrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities, and how often in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions and new paths: he knows still better from his painfulest recollections on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank have hitherto usually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become contemptible. the universal degeneracy of mankind to the level of the man of the future as idealized by the socialistic fools and shallow-pates this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely gregarious animal (or as they call it, to a man of free society), this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is undoubtedly possible he who has thought out this possibility to its ultimate conclusion knows another loathing unknown to the rest of mankind and perhaps also a new mission chapter vi. we scholars at the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that which it has always been namely, resolutely montrer ses plaies, according to balzac i would venture to protest against an improper and injurious alteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the best conscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations of science and philosophy. i mean to say that one must have the right out of one's own experience experience, as it seems to me, always implies unfortunate experience to treat of such an important question of rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or against science like women and artists (ah this dreadful science sigh their instinct and their shame, it always finds things out ). the declaration of independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy, is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and disorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best springtime which does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise smells sweet. here also the instinct of the populace cries, freedom from all masters and after science has, with the happiest results, resisted theology, whose hand-maid it had been too long, it now proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for philosophy, and in its turn to play the master what am i saying to play the philosopher on its own account. my memory the memory of a scientific man, if you please teems with the naivetes of insolence which i have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young naturalists and old physicians (not to mention the most cultured and most conceited of all learned men, the philologists and schoolmasters, who are both the one and the other by profession). on one occasion it was the specialist and the jack horner who instinctively stood on the defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of otium and refined luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. on another occasion it was the colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but a series of refuted systems, and an extravagant expenditure which does nobody any good. at another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another time the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily extended to disregard of philosophy generally. in fine, i found most frequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars, the evil after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the whole obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of the result being a general ill-will to all philosophy. (such seems to me, for instance, the after-effect of schopenhauer on the most modern germany: by his unintelligent rage against hegel, he has succeeded in severing the whole of the last generation of germans from its connection with german culture, which culture, all things considered, has been an elevation and a divining refinement of the historical sense, but precisely at this point schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive, and un-german to the extent of ingeniousness.) on the whole, speaking generally, it may just have been the humanness, all-too-humanness of the modern philosophers themselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the doors to the instinct of the populace. let it but be acknowledged to what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the world of heraclitus, plato, empedocles, and whatever else all the royal and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called, and with what justice an honest man of science may feel himself of a better family and origin, in view of such representatives of philosophy, who, owing to the fashion of the present day, are just as much aloft as they are down below in germany, for instance, the two lions of berlin, the anarchist eugen duhring and the amalgamist eduard von hartmann. it is especially the sight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves realists, or positivists, which is calculated to implant a dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those philosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and specialists, that is very evident all of them are persons who have been vanquished and brought back again under the dominion of science, who at one time or another claimed more from themselves, without having a right to the more and its responsibility and who now, creditably, rancorously, and vindictively, represent in word and deed, disbelief in the master-task and supremacy of philosophy after all, how could it be otherwise science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible on its countenance, while that to which the entire modern philosophy has gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the present day, excites distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity philosophy reduced to a theory of knowledge, no more in fact than a diffident science of epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even gets beyond the threshold, and rigorously denies itself the right to enter that is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony, something that awakens pity. how could such a philosophy rule the dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit could still come to maturity. the extent and towering structure of the sciences have increased enormously, and therewith also the probability that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach himself somewhere and specialize so that he will no longer attain to his elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection, and his despection. or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his maturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no longer of much importance. it is perhaps just the refinement of his intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the way, he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a milleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost his self-respect no longer commands, no longer leads, unless he should aspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical cagliostro and spiritual rat-catcher in short, a misleader. this is in the last instance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of conscience. to double once more the philosopher's difficulties, there is also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a yea or nay, not concerning science, but concerning life and the worth of life he learns unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain this verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief only through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying) experiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded. in fact, the philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either with the scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously elevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and god-intoxicated man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised, because he lives wisely, or as a philosopher, it hardly means anything more than prudently and apart. wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kind of flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a bad game; but the genuine philosopher does it not seem so to us, my friends lives unphilosophically and unwisely, above all, imprudently, and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts and temptations of life he risks himself constantly, he plays this bad game. in relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either engenders or produces both words understood in their fullest sense the man of learning, the scientific average man, has always something of the old maid about him; for, like her, he is not conversant with the two principal functions of man. to both, of course, to the scholar and to the old maid, one concedes respectability, as if by way of indemnification in these cases one emphasizes the respectability and yet, in the compulsion of this concession, one has the same admixture of vexation. let us examine more closely: what is the scientific man firstly, a commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is to say, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type of man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file, equability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the instinct for people like himself, and for that which they require for instance: the portion of independence and green meadow without which there is no rest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration (which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability), the sunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness, with which the inward distrust which lies at the bottom of the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and again to be overcome. the learned man, as is appropriate, has also maladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and has a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations he cannot attain. he is confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go, but does not flow; and precisely before the man of the great current he stands all the colder and more reserved his eye is then like a smooth and irresponsive lake, which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy. the worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results from the instinct of mediocrity of his type, from the jesuitism of mediocrity, which labours instinctively for the destruction of the exceptional man, and endeavours to break or still better, to relax every bent bow to relax, of course, with consideration, and naturally with an indulgent hand to relax with confiding sympathy that is the real art of jesuitism, which has always understood how to introduce itself as the religion of sympathy. however gratefully one may welcome the objective spirit and who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded ipsisimosity in the end, however, one must learn caution even with regard to one's gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been celebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation and glorification as is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the highest honours to disinterested knowledge the objective man, who no longer curses and scolds like the pessimist, the ideal man of learning in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand complete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly instruments that exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful he is only an instrument, we may say, he is a mirror he is no purpose in himself the objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration before everything that wants to be known, with such desires only as knowing or reflecting implies he waits until something comes, and then expands himself sensitively, so that even the light footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface and film whatever personality he still possesses seems to him accidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms and events he calls up the recollection of himself with an effort, and not infrequently wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other persons, he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only is he unrefined and negligent perhaps he is troubled about the health, or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack of companions and society indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his suffering, but in vain his thoughts already rove away to the more general case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how to help himself he does not now take himself seriously and devote time to himself he is serene, not from lack of trouble, but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing with his trouble the habitual complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences, the radiant and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that comes his way, his habit of inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous indifference as to yea and nay: alas there are enough of cases in which he has to atone for these virtues of his and as man generally, he becomes far too easily the caput mortuum of such virtues. should one wish love or hatred from him i mean love and hatred as god, woman, and animal understand them he will do what he can, and furnish what he can. but one must not be surprised if it should not be much if he should show himself just at this point to be false, fragile, questionable, and deteriorated. his love is constrained, his hatred is artificial, and rather un tour de force, a slight ostentation and exaggeration. he is only genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totality is he still nature and natural. his mirroring and eternally self-polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm, no longer how to deny; he does not command; neither does he destroy. je ne meprise presque rien he says, with leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue the presque neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of any one, nor after, either; he places himself generally too far off to have any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil. if he has been so long confounded with the philosopher, with the caesarian trainer and dictator of civilization, he has had far too much honour, and what is more essential in him has been overlooked he is an instrument, something of a slave, though certainly the sublimest sort of slave, but nothing in himself presque rien the objective man is an instrument, a costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring instrument and mirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and respected; but he is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary man in whom the rest of existence justifies itself, no termination and still less a commencement, an engendering, or primary cause, nothing hardy, powerful, self-centred, that wants to be master; but rather only a soft, inflated, delicate, movable potter's-form, that must wait for some kind of content and frame to shape itself thereto for the most part a man without frame and content, a selfless man. consequently, also, nothing for women, in parenthesi. when a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic i hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the objective spirit people all hear it impatiently; they regard him on that account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many, many questions... indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so many, he is henceforth said to be dangerous. with his repudiation of skepticism, it seems to them as if they heard some evil-threatening sound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried somewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered russian nihiline, a pessimism bonae voluntatis, that not only denies, means denial, but dreadful thought practises denial. against this kind of good-will a will to the veritable, actual negation of life there is, as is generally acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative than skepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism; and hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an antidote to the spirit, and its underground noises. are not our ears already full of bad sounds say the skeptics, as lovers of repose, and almost as a kind of safety police; this subterranean nay is terrible be still, ye pessimistic moles the skeptic, in effect, that delicate creature, is far too easily frightened; his conscience is schooled so as to start at every nay, and even at that sharp, decided yea, and feels something like a bite thereby. yea and nay they seem to him opposed to morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a festival to his virtue by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with montaigne: what do i know or with socrates: i know that i know nothing. or: here i do not trust myself, no door is open to me. or: even if the door were open, why should i enter immediately or: what is the use of any hasty hypotheses it might quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses at all. are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is crooked to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum is there not time enough for that has not the time leisure oh, ye demons, can ye not at all wait the uncertain also has its charms, the sphinx, too, is a circe, and circe, too, was a philosopher. thus does a skeptic console himself; and in truth he needs some consolation. for skepticism is the most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiological temperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and sickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been long separated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another. in the new generation, which has inherited as it were different standards and valuations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and tentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues prevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium, ballast, and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. that, however, which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the will; they are no longer familiar with independence of decision, or the courageous feeling of pleasure in willing they are doubtful of the freedom of the will even in their dreams our present-day europe, the scene of a senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes, and consequently of races, is therefore skeptical in all its heights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with gloomy aspect, like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signs and often sick unto death of its will paralysis of will, where do we not find this cripple sitting nowadays and yet how bedecked oftentimes' how seductively ornamented there are the finest gala dresses and disguises for this disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself nowadays in the show-cases as objectiveness, the scientific spirit, l'art pour l'art, and pure voluntary knowledge, is only decked-out skepticism and paralysis of will i am ready to answer for this diagnosis of the european disease the disease of the will is diffused unequally over europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization has longest prevailed, it decreases according as the barbarian still or again asserts his claims under the loose drapery of western culture it is therefore in the france of today, as can be readily disclosed and comprehended, that the will is most infirm, and france, which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive, now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over europe, by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism the power to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is already somewhat stronger in germany, and again in the north of germany it is stronger than in central germany, it is considerably stronger in england, spain, and corsica, associated with phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the latter not to mention italy, which is too young yet to know what it wants, and must first show whether it can exercise will, but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle empire where europe as it were flows back to asia namely, in russia there the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated, there the will uncertain whether to be negative or affirmative waits threateningly to be discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from our physicists) perhaps not only indian wars and complications in asia would be necessary to free europe from its greatest danger, but also internal subversion, the shattering of the empire into small states, and above all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility, together with the obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast i do not say this as one who desires it, in my heart i should rather prefer the contrary i mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of russia, that europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threatening namely, to acquire one will, by means of a new caste to rule over the continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that can set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-out comedy of its petty-statism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic many-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close. the time for petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the dominion of the world the compulsion to great politics. as to how far the new warlike age on which we europeans have evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger kind of skepticism, i should like to express myself preliminarily merely by a parable, which the lovers of german history will already understand. that unscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers (who, as king of prussia, brought into being a military and skeptical genius and therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged type of german), the problematic, crazy father of frederick the great, had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew what was then lacking in germany, the want of which was a hundred times more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form his ill-will to the young frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound instinct. men were lacking; and he suspected, to his bitterest regret, that his own son was not man enough. there, however, he deceived himself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place he saw his son lapsed to atheism, to the esprit, to the pleasant frivolity of clever frenchmen he saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the spider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no longer hard enough either for evil or good, and of a broken will that no longer commands, is no longer able to command. meanwhile, however, there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous skepticism who knows to what extent it was encouraged just by his father's hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to solitude the skepticism of daring manliness, which is closely related to the genius for war and conquest, and made its first entrance into germany in the person of the great frederick. this skepticism despises and nevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it does not believe, but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit a dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the heart. it is the german form of skepticism, which, as a continued fredericianism, risen to the highest spirituality, has kept europe for a considerable time under the dominion of the german spirit and its critical and historical distrust owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character of the great german philologists and historical critics (who, rightly estimated, were also all of them artists of destruction and dissolution), a new conception of the german spirit gradually established itself in spite of all romanticism in music and philosophy in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was decidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, as courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute will to dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized north pole expeditions under barren and dangerous skies. there may be good grounds for it when warm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this spirit, cet esprit fataliste, ironique, mephistophelique, as michelet calls it, not without a shudder. but if one would realize how characteristic is this fear of the man in the german spirit which awakened europe out of its dogmatic slumber, let us call to mind the former conception which had to be overcome by this new one and that it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with unbridled presumption, to recommend the germans to the interest of europe as gentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools. finally, let us only understand profoundly enough napoleon's astonishment when he saw goethe it reveals what had been regarded for centuries as the german spirit voila un homme that was as much as to say but this is a man and i only expected to see a german supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the future, some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps be skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in them would only be designated thereby and not they themselves. with equal right they might call themselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of experiments. by the name with which i ventured to baptize them, i have already expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is this because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use of experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense in their passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in daring and painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic century can approve of there is no doubt these coming ones will be least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities which distinguish the critic from the skeptic i mean the certainty as to standards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method, the wary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for self-responsibility, indeed, they will avow among themselves a delight in denial and dissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows how to handle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds they will be sterner (and perhaps not always towards themselves only) than humane people may desire, they will not deal with the truth in order that it may please them, or elevate and inspire them they will rather have little faith in truth bringing with it such revels for the feelings. they will smile, those rigorous spirits, when any one says in their presence that thought elevates me, why should it not be true or that work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful or that artist enlarges me, why should he not be great perhaps they will not only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus rapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one could look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily find therein the intention to reconcile christian sentiments with antique taste, or even with modern parliamentarism (the kind of reconciliation necessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and consequently very conciliatory century). critical discipline, and every habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters, will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of the future, they may even make a display thereof as their special adornment nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that account. it will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to have it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that philosophy itself is criticism and critical science and nothing else whatever though this estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the positivists of france and germany (and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste of kant: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works), our new philosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are instruments of the philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments, they are far from being philosophers themselves even the great chinaman of konigsberg was only a great critic. i insist upon it that people finally cease confounding philosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with philosophers that precisely here one should strictly give each his own, and not give those far too much, these far too little. it may be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants, the scientific workers of philosophy, remain standing, and must remain standing he himself must perhaps have been critic, and dogmatist, and historian, and besides, poet, and collector, and traveler, and riddle-reader, and moralist, and seer, and free spirit, and almost everything, in order to traverse the whole range of human values and estimations, and that he may be able with a variety of eyes and consciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth up to any height, from a nook into any expanse. but all these are only preliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands something else it requires him to create values. the philosophical workers, after the excellent pattern of kant and hegel, have to fix and formalize some great existing body of valuations that is to say, former determinations of value, creations of value, which have become prevalent, and are for a time called truths whether in the domain of the logical, the political (moral), or the artistic. it is for these investigators to make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto, conspicuous, conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to shorten everything long, even time itself, and to subjugate the entire past: an immense and wonderful task, in the carrying out of which all refined pride, all tenacious will, can surely find satisfaction. the real philosophers, however, are commanders and law-givers; they say: thus shall it be they determine first the whither and the why of mankind, and thereby set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and all subjugators of the past they grasp at the future with a creative hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an instrument, and a hammer. their knowing is creating, their creating is a law-giving, their will to truth is will to power. are there at present such philosophers have there ever been such philosophers must there not be such philosophers some day ... it is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man indispensable for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever found himself, and has been obliged to find himself, in contradiction to the day in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his day. hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one calls philosophers who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom, but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators have found their mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end, however, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of their age. in putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very virtues of their age, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been for the sake of a new greatness of man, a new untrodden path to his aggrandizement. they have always disclosed how much hypocrisy, indolence, self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how much virtue was outlived, they have always said we must remove hence to where you are least at home in the face of a world of modern ideas, which would like to confine every one in a corner, in a specialty, a philosopher, if there could be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled to place the greatness of man, the conception of greatness, precisely in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness, in his all-roundness, he would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which a man could bear and take upon himself, according to the extent to which a man could stretch his responsibility nowadays the taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will, nothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently, in the ideal of the philosopher, strength of will, sternness, and capacity for prolonged resolution, must specially be included in the conception of greatness, with as good a right as the opposite doctrine, with its ideal of a silly, renouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to an opposite age such as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its accumulated energy of will, and from the wildest torrents and floods of selfishness in the time of socrates, among men only of worn-out instincts, old conservative athenians who let themselves go for the sake of happiness, as they said, for the sake of pleasure, as their conduct indicated and who had continually on their lips the old pompous words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led, irony was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul, the wicked socratic assurance of the old physician and plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh, as into the flesh and heart of the noble, with a look that said plainly enough do not dissemble before me here we are equal at present, on the contrary, when throughout europe the herding-animal alone attains to honours, and dispenses honours, when equality of right can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong i mean to say into general war against everything rare, strange, and privileged, against the higher man, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher responsibility, the creative plenipotence and lordliness at present it belongs to the conception of greatness to be noble, to wish to be apart, to be capable of being different, to stand alone, to have to live by personal initiative, and the philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts he shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good and evil, the master of his virtues, and of super-abundance of will; precisely this shall be called greatness: as diversified as can be entire, as ample as can be full. and to ask once more the question: is greatness possible nowadays it is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot be taught: one must know it by experience or one should have the pride not to know it. the fact that at present people all talk of things of which they cannot have any experience, is true more especially and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical matters: the very few know them, are permitted to know them, and all popular ideas about them are false. thus, for instance, the truly philosophical combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs at presto pace, and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no false step, is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own experience, and therefore, should any one speak of it in their presence, it is incredible to them. they conceive of every necessity as troublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint; thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating, almost as a trouble, and often enough as worthy of the sweat of the noble but not at all as something easy and divine, closely related to dancing and exuberance to think and to take a matter seriously, arduously that is one and the same thing to them; such only has been their experience. artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything arbitrarily, and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom, of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping, reaches its climax in short, that necessity and freedom of will are then the same thing with them. there is, in fine, a gradation of rank in psychical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who ventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution by the loftiness and power of his spirituality. of what use is it for nimble, everyday intellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists to press, in their plebeian ambition, close to such problems, and as it were into this holy of holies as so often happens nowadays but coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is provided for in the primary law of things; the doors remain closed to those intruders, though they may dash and break their heads thereon. people have always to be born to a high station, or, more definitely, they have to be bred for it: a person has only a right to philosophy taking the word in its higher significance in virtue of his descent; the ancestors, the blood, decide here also. many generations must have prepared the way for the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have been separately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the bold, easy, delicate course and current of his thoughts, but above all the readiness for great responsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance and contemning look, the feeling of separation from the multitude with their duties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever is misunderstood and calumniated, be it god or devil, the delight and practice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of will, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely loves.... chapter vii. our virtues our virtues it is probable that we, too, have still our virtues, although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues on account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a little distance from us. we europeans of the day after tomorrow, we firstlings of the twentieth century with all our dangerous curiosity, our multifariousness and art of disguising, our mellow and seemingly sweetened cruelty in sense and spirit we shall presumably, if we must have virtues, have those only which have come to agreement with our most secret and heartfelt inclinations, with our most ardent requirements: well, then, let us look for them in our labyrinths where, as we know, so many things lose themselves, so many things get quite lost and is there anything finer than to search for one's own virtues is it not almost to believe in one's own virtues but this believing in one's own virtues is it not practically the same as what was formerly called one's good conscience, that long, respectable pigtail of an idea, which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often enough also behind their understandings it seems, therefore, that however little we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly respectable in other respects, in one thing we are nevertheless the worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last europeans with good consciences: we also still wear their pigtail. ah if you only knew how soon, so very soon it will be different as in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different colours shine around a single planet, now with red light, now with green, and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley colours: so we modern men, owing to the complicated mechanism of our firmament, are determined by different moralities; our actions shine alternately in different colours, and are seldom unequivocal and there are often cases, also, in which our actions are motley-coloured. to love one's enemies i think that has been well learnt: it takes place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeed, at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place: we learn to despise when we love, and precisely when we love best; all of it, however, unconsciously, without noise, without ostentation, with the shame and secrecy of goodness, which forbids the utterance of the pompous word and the formula of virtue. morality as attitude is opposed to our taste nowadays. this is also an advance, as it was an advance in our fathers that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste, including the enmity and voltairean bitterness against religion (and all that formerly belonged to freethinker-pantomime). it is the music in our conscience, the dance in our spirit, to which puritan litanies, moral sermons, and goody-goodness won't chime. let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment they never forgive us if they have once made a mistake before us (or even with regard to us) they inevitably become our instinctive calumniators and detractors, even when they still remain our friends. blessed are the forgetful: for they get the better even of their blunders. the psychologists of france and where else are there still psychologists nowadays have never yet exhausted their bitter and manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise, just as though... in short, they betray something thereby. flaubert, for instance, the honest citizen of rouen, neither saw, heard, nor tasted anything else in the end; it was his mode of self-torment and refined cruelty. as this is growing wearisome, i would now recommend for a change something else for a pleasure namely, the unconscious astuteness with which good, fat, honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks they have to perform, the subtle, barbed, jesuitical astuteness, which is a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the middle-class in its best moments subtler even than the understanding of its victims: a repeated proof that instinct is the most intelligent of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered. in short, you psychologists, study the philosophy of the rule in its struggle with the exception: there you have a spectacle fit for gods and godlike malignity or, in plainer words, practise vivisection on good people, on the homo bonae voluntatis, on yourselves the practice of judging and condemning morally, is the favourite revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so, it is also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature, and finally, it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and becoming subtle malice spiritualises. they are glad in their inmost heart that there is a standard according to which those who are over-endowed with intellectual goods and privileges, are equal to them, they contend for the equality of all before god, and almost need the belief in god for this purpose. it is among them that the most powerful antagonists of atheism are found. if any one were to say to them a lofty spirituality is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely moral man it would make them furious, i shall take care not to say so. i would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities, that it is a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the merely moral man, after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice, perhaps during a whole series of generations, that lofty spirituality is precisely the spiritualising of justice, and the beneficent severity which knows that it is authorized to maintain gradations of rank in the world, even among things and not only among men. now that the praise of the disinterested person is so popular one must probably not without some danger get an idea of what people actually take an interest in, and what are the things generally which fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men including the cultured, even the learned, and perhaps philosophers also, if appearances do not deceive. the fact thereby becomes obvious that the greater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more refined and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely uninteresting to the average man if, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these interests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to act disinterestedly. there have been philosophers who could give this popular astonishment a seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression (perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience ), instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that disinterested action is very interesting and interested action, provided that... and love what even an action for love's sake shall be unegoistic but you fools and the praise of the self-sacrificer but whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that he wanted and obtained something for it perhaps something from himself for something from himself; that he relinquished here in order to have more there, perhaps in general to be more, or even feel himself more. but this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidious spirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to stifle her yawns so much when she is obliged to answer. and after all, truth is a woman; one must not use force with her. it sometimes happens, said a moralistic pedant and trifle-retailer, that i honour and respect an unselfish man: not, however, because he is unselfish, but because i think he has a right to be useful to another man at his own expense. in short, the question is always who he is, and who the other is. for instance, in a person created and destined for command, self-denial and modest retirement, instead of being virtues, would be the waste of virtues: so it seems to me. every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself unconditionally and appeals to every one, not only sins against good taste, but is also an incentive to sins of omission, an additional seduction under the mask of philanthropy and precisely a seduction and injury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of men. moral systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the gradations of rank; their presumption must be driven home to their conscience until they thoroughly understand at last that it is immoral to say that 'what is right for one is proper for another.' so said my moralistic pedant and bonhomme. did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus exhorted systems of morals to practise morality but one should not be too much in the right if one wishes to have the laughers on one's own side; a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste. wherever sympathy (fellow-suffering) is preached nowadays and, if i gather rightly, no other religion is any longer preached let the psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity, through all the noise which is natural to these preachers (as to all preachers), he will hear a hoarse, groaning, genuine note of self-contempt. it belongs to the overshadowing and uglifying of europe, which has been on the increase for a century (the first symptoms of which are already specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of galiani to madame d'epinay) if it is not really the cause thereof the man of modern ideas, the conceited ape, is excessively dissatisfied with himself this is perfectly certain. he suffers, and his vanity wants him only to suffer with his fellows. the hybrid european a tolerably ugly plebeian, taken all in all absolutely requires a costume: he needs history as a storeroom of costumes. to be sure, he notices that none of the costumes fit him properly he changes and changes. let us look at the nineteenth century with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades of style, and also with respect to its moments of desperation on account of nothing suiting us. it is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic, or classical, or christian, or florentine, or barocco, or national, in moribus et artibus: it does not clothe us but the spirit, especially the historical spirit, profits even by this desperation: once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested, put on, taken off, packed up, and above all studied we are the first studious age in puncto of costumes, i mean as concerns morals, articles of belief, artistic tastes, and religions; we are prepared as no other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style, for the most spiritual festival laughter and arrogance, for the transcendental height of supreme folly and aristophanic ridicule of the world. perhaps we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here, the domain where even we can still be original, probably as parodists of the world's history and as god's merry-andrews, perhaps, though nothing else of the present have a future, our laughter itself may have a future the historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly the order of rank of the valuations according to which a people, a community, or an individual has lived, the divining instinct for the relationships of these valuations, for the relation of the authority of the valuations to the authority of the operating forces), this historical sense, which we europeans claim as our specialty, has come to us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi-barbarity into which europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and races it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this faculty as its sixth sense. owing to this mingling, the past of every form and mode of life, and of cultures which were formerly closely contiguous and superimposed on one another, flows forth into us modern souls; our instincts now run back in all directions, we ourselves are a kind of chaos: in the end, as we have said, the spirit perceives its advantage therein. by means of our semi-barbarity in body and in desire, we have secret access everywhere, such as a noble age never had; we have access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations, and to every form of semi-barbarity that has at any time existed on earth; and in so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto has just been semi-barbarity, the historical sense implies almost the sense and instinct for everything, the taste and tongue for everything: whereby it immediately proves itself to be an ignoble sense. for instance, we enjoy homer once more: it is perhaps our happiest acquisition that we know how to appreciate homer, whom men of distinguished culture (as the french of the seventeenth century, like saint-evremond, who reproached him for his esprit vaste, and even voltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so easily appropriate whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy. the very decided yea and nay of their palate, their promptly ready disgust, their hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange, their horror of the bad taste even of lively curiosity, and in general the averseness of every distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desire, a dissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what is strange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards the best things of the world which are not their property or could not become their prey and no faculty is more unintelligible to such men than just this historical sense, with its truckling, plebeian curiosity. the case is not different with shakespeare, that marvelous spanish-moorish-saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient athenian of the circle of aeschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter or irritation: but we accept precisely this wild motleyness, this medley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial, with a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement of art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as little disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the english populace in which shakespeare's art and taste lives, as perhaps on the chiaja of naples, where, with all our senses awake, we go our way, enchanted and voluntarily, in spite of the drain-odour of the lower quarters of the town. that as men of the historical sense we have our virtues, is not to be disputed: we are unpretentious, unselfish, modest, brave, habituated to self-control and self-renunciation, very grateful, very patient, very complaisant but with all this we are perhaps not very tasteful. let us finally confess it, that what is most difficult for us men of the historical sense to grasp, feel, taste, and love, what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost hostile, is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every culture and art, the essentially noble in works and men, their moment of smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency, the goldenness and coldness which all things show that have perfected themselves. perhaps our great virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to good taste, at least to the very bad taste; and we can only evoke in ourselves imperfectly, hesitatingly, and with compulsion the small, short, and happy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and there: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power has voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite, when a super-abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checking and petrifying, by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still trembling ground. proportionateness is strange to us, let us confess it to ourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite, the immeasurable. like the rider on his forward panting horse, we let the reins fall before the infinite, we modern men, we semi-barbarians and are only in our highest bliss when we are in most danger. whether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or eudaemonism, all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according to pleasure and pain, that is, according to accompanying circumstances and secondary considerations, are plausible modes of thought and naivetes, which every one conscious of creative powers and an artist's conscience will look down upon with scorn, though not without sympathy. sympathy for you to be sure, that is not sympathy as you understand it: it is not sympathy for social distress, for society with its sick and misfortuned, for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie on the ground around us; still less is it sympathy for the grumbling, vexed, revolutionary slave-classes who strive after power they call it freedom. our sympathy is a loftier and further-sighted sympathy: we see how man dwarfs himself, how you dwarf him and there are moments when we view your sympathy with an indescribable anguish, when we resist it, when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind of levity. you want, if possible and there is not a more foolish if possible to do away with suffering; and we it really seems that we would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been well-being, as you understand it is certainly not a goal; it seems to us an end; a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and contemptible and makes his destruction desirable the discipline of suffering, of great suffering know ye not that it is only this discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto the tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energy, its shuddering in view of rack and ruin, its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing, enduring, interpreting, and exploiting misfortune, and whatever depth, mystery, disguise, spirit, artifice, or greatness has been bestowed upon the soul has it not been bestowed through suffering, through the discipline of great suffering in man creature and creator are united: in man there is not only matter, shred, excess, clay, mire, folly, chaos; but there is also the creator, the sculptor, the hardness of the hammer, the divinity of the spectator, and the seventh day do ye understand this contrast and that your sympathy for the creature in man applies to that which has to be fashioned, bruised, forged, stretched, roasted, annealed, refined to that which must necessarily suffer, and is meant to suffer and our sympathy do ye not understand what our reverse sympathy applies to, when it resists your sympathy as the worst of all pampering and enervation so it is sympathy against sympathy but to repeat it once more, there are higher problems than the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy; and all systems of philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes. we immoralists. this world with which we are concerned, in which we have to fear and love, this almost invisible, inaudible world of delicate command and delicate obedience, a world of almost in every respect, captious, insidious, sharp, and tender yes, it is well protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity we are woven into a strong net and garment of duties, and cannot disengage ourselves precisely here, we are men of duty, even we occasionally, it is true, we dance in our chains and betwixt our swords; it is none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under the circumstances, and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot. but do what we will, fools and appearances say of us: these are men without duty, we have always fools and appearances against us honesty, granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot rid ourselves, we free spirits well, we will labour at it with all our perversity and love, and not tire of perfecting ourselves in our virtue, which alone remains: may its glance some day overspread like a gilded, blue, mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull gloomy seriousness and if, nevertheless, our honesty should one day grow weary, and sigh, and stretch its limbs, and find us too hard, and would fain have it pleasanter, easier, and gentler, like an agreeable vice, let us remain hard, we latest stoics, and let us send to its help whatever devilry we have in us: our disgust at the clumsy and undefined, our nitimur in vetitum, our love of adventure, our sharpened and fastidious curiosity, our most subtle, disguised, intellectual will to power and universal conquest, which rambles and roves avidiously around all the realms of the future let us go with all our devils to the help of our god it is probable that people will misunderstand and mistake us on that account: what does it matter they will say: their 'honesty' that is their devilry, and nothing else what does it matter and even if they were right have not all gods hitherto been such sanctified, re-baptized devils and after all, what do we know of ourselves and what the spirit that leads us wants to be called (it is a question of names.) and how many spirits we harbour our honesty, we free spirits let us be careful lest it become our vanity, our ornament and ostentation, our limitation, our stupidity every virtue inclines to stupidity, every stupidity to virtue; stupid to the point of sanctity, they say in russia, let us be careful lest out of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores is not life a hundred times too short for us to bore ourselves one would have to believe in eternal life in order to... i hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific appliances and that virtue, in my opinion, has been more injured by the tediousness of its advocates than by anything else; at the same time, however, i would not wish to overlook their general usefulness. it is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals, and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day become interesting but let us not be afraid things still remain today as they have always been: i see no one in europe who has (or discloses) an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be conducted in a dangerous, captious, and ensnaring manner that calamity might be involved therein. observe, for example, the indefatigable, inevitable english utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably they stalk on, stalk along (a homeric metaphor expresses it better) in the footsteps of bentham, just as he had already stalked in the footsteps of the respectable helvetius (no, he was not a dangerous man, helvetius, ce senateur pococurante, to use an expression of galiani). no new thought, nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression of an old thought, not even a proper history of what has been previously thought on the subject: an impossible literature, taking it all in all, unless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief. in effect, the old english vice called cant, which is moral tartuffism, has insinuated itself also into these moralists (whom one must certainly read with an eye to their motives if one must read them), concealed this time under the new form of the scientific spirit; moreover, there is not absent from them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience, from which a race of former puritans must naturally suffer, in all their scientific tinkering with morals. (is not a moralist the opposite of a puritan that is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable, as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem is moralizing not-immoral ) in the end, they all want english morality to be recognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the general utility, or the happiness of the greatest number, no the happiness of england, will be best served thereby. they would like, by all means, to convince themselves that the striving after english happiness, i mean after comfort and fashion (and in the highest instance, a seat in parliament), is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact, that in so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has just consisted in such striving. not one of those ponderous, conscience-stricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate the cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to have any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the general welfare is no ideal, no goal, no notion that can be at all grasped, but is only a nostrum, that what is fair to one may not at all be fair to another, that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to higher men, in short, that there is a distinction of rank between man and man, and consequently between morality and morality. they are an unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian englishmen, and, as already remarked, in so far as they are tedious, one cannot think highly enough of their utility. one ought even to encourage them, as has been partially attempted in the following rhymes: hail, ye worthies, barrow-wheeling, longer better, aye revealing, stiffer aye in head and knee; unenraptured, never jesting, mediocre everlasting, sans genie et sans esprit in these later ages, which may be proud of their humanity, there still remains so much fear, so much superstition of the fear, of the cruel wild beast, the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of these humaner ages that even obvious truths, as if by the agreement of centuries, have long remained unuttered, because they have the appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again. i perhaps risk something when i allow such a truth to escape; let others capture it again and give it so much milk of pious sentiment [footnote: an expression from schiller's william tell, act iv, scene] to drink, that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in its old corner. one ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open one's eyes; one ought at last to learn impatience, in order that such immodest gross errors as, for instance, have been fostered by ancient and modern philosophers with regard to tragedy may no longer wander about virtuously and boldly. almost everything that we call higher culture is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of cruelty this is my thesis; the wild beast has not been slain at all, it lives, it flourishes, it has only been transfigured. that which constitutes the painful delight of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in so-called tragic sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime, up to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains its sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. what the roman enjoys in the arena, the christian in the ecstasies of the cross, the spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake, or of the bull-fight, the present-day japanese who presses his way to the tragedy, the workman of the parisian suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions, the wagnerienne who, with unhinged will, undergoes the performance of tristan and isolde what all these enjoy, and strive with mysterious ardour to drink in, is the philtre of the great circe cruelty. here, to be sure, we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of former times, which could only teach with regard to cruelty that it originated at the sight of the suffering of others: there is an abundant, super-abundant enjoyment even in one's own suffering, in causing one's own suffering and wherever man has allowed himself to be persuaded to self-denial in the religious sense, or to self-mutilation, as among the phoenicians and ascetics, or in general, to desensualisation, decarnalisation, and contrition, to puritanical repentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience and to pascal-like sacrifizia dell' intelleto, he is secretly allured and impelled forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of cruelty towards himself. finally, let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty, in that he compels his spirit to perceive against its own inclination, and often enough against the wishes of his heart: he forces it to say nay, where he would like to affirm, love, and adore; indeed, every instance of taking a thing profoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an intentional injuring of the fundamental will of the spirit, which instinctively aims at appearance and superficiality, even in every desire for knowledge there is a drop of cruelty. perhaps what i have said here about a fundamental will of the spirit may not be understood without further details; i may be allowed a word of explanation. that imperious something which is popularly called the spirit, wishes to be master internally and externally, and to feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a simplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will. its requirements and capacities here, are the same as those assigned by physiologists to everything that lives, grows, and multiplies. the power of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong tendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold, to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it arbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself certain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of the outside world. its object thereby is the incorporation of new experiences, the assortment of new things in the old arrangements in short, growth; or more properly, the feeling of growth, the feeling of increased power is its object. this same will has at its service an apparently opposed impulse of the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference of ignorance, of arbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner denial of this or that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive attitude against much that is knowable, a contentment with obscurity, with the shutting-in horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance: as that which is all necessary according to the degree of its appropriating power, its digestive power, to speak figuratively (and in fact the spirit resembles a stomach more than anything else). here also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be deceived (perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is not so and so, but is only allowed to pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and ambiguity, an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness and mystery, of the too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified, the diminished, the misshapen, the beautified an enjoyment of the arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. finally, in this connection, there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to deceive other spirits and dissemble before them the constant pressing and straining of a creating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit enjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys also its feeling of security therein it is precisely by its protean arts that it is best protected and concealed counter to this propensity for appearance, for simplification, for a disguise, for a cloak, in short, for an outside for every outside is a cloak there operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge, which takes, and insists on taking things profoundly, variously, and thoroughly; as a kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste, which every courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself, provided, as it ought to be, that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for introspection, and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe words. he will say: there is something cruel in the tendency of my spirit: let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not so in fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty, perhaps our extravagant honesty were talked about, whispered about, and glorified we free, very free spirits and some day perhaps such will actually be our posthumous glory meanwhile for there is plenty of time until then we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in such florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work has just made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance. they are beautiful, glistening, jingling, festive words: honesty, love of truth, love of wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, heroism of the truthful there is something in them that makes one's heart swell with pride. but we anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the secrecy of an anchorite's conscience, that this worthy parade of verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment, frippery, and gold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and that even under such flattering colour and repainting, the terrible original text homo natura must again be recognized. in effect, to translate man back again into nature; to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over the eternal original text, homo natura; to bring it about that man shall henceforth stand before man as he now, hardened by the discipline of science, stands before the other forms of nature, with fearless oedipus-eyes, and stopped ulysses-ears, deaf to the enticements of old metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to him far too long: thou art more thou art higher thou hast a different origin this may be a strange and foolish task, but that it is a task, who can deny why did we choose it, this foolish task or, to put the question differently: why knowledge at all every one will ask us about this. and thus pressed, we, who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times, have not found and cannot find any better answer.... learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that does not merely conserve as the physiologist knows. but at the bottom of our souls, quite down below, there is certainly something unteachable, a granite of spiritual fate, of predetermined decision and answer to predetermined, chosen questions. in each cardinal problem there speaks an unchangeable i am this; a thinker cannot learn anew about man and woman, for instance, but can only learn fully he can only follow to the end what is fixed about them in himself. occasionally we find certain solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us; perhaps they are henceforth called convictions. later on one sees in them only footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the problem which we ourselves are or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody, our spiritual fate, the unteachable in us, quite down below. in view of this liberal compliment which i have just paid myself, permission will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about woman as she is, provided that it is known at the outset how literally they are merely my truths. woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she begins to enlighten men about woman as she is this is one of the worst developments of the general uglifying of europe. for what must these clumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-exposure bring to light woman has so much cause for shame; in woman there is so much pedantry, superficiality, schoolmasterliness, petty presumption, unbridledness, and indiscretion concealed study only woman's behaviour towards children which has really been best restrained and dominated hitherto by the fear of man. alas, if ever the eternally tedious in woman she has plenty of it is allowed to venture forth if she begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art-of charming, of playing, of frightening away sorrow, of alleviating and taking easily; if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable desires female voices are already raised, which, by saint aristophanes make one afraid: with medical explicitness it is stated in a threatening manner what woman first and last requires from man. is it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be scientific enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men's affair, men's gift we remained therewith among ourselves; and in the end, in view of all that women write about woman, we may well have considerable doubt as to whether woman really desires enlightenment about herself and can desire it. if woman does not thereby seek a new ornament for herself i believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally feminine why, then, she wishes to make herself feared: perhaps she thereby wishes to get the mastery. but she does not want truth what does woman care for truth from the very first, nothing is more foreign, more repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truth her great art is falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. let us confess it, we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in woman: we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the company of beings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our seriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to us. finally, i ask the question: did a woman herself ever acknowledge profundity in a woman's mind, or justice in a woman's heart and is it not true that on the whole woman has hitherto been most despised by woman herself, and not at all by us we men desire that woman should not continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it was man's care and the consideration for woman, when the church decreed: mulier taceat in ecclesia. it was to the benefit of woman when napoleon gave the too eloquent madame de stael to understand: mulier taceat in politicis and in my opinion, he is a true friend of woman who calls out to women today: mulier taceat de mulierel. it betrays corruption of the instincts apart from the fact that it betrays bad taste when a woman refers to madame roland, or madame de stael, or monsieur george sand, as though something were proved thereby in favour of woman as she is. among men, these are the three comical women as they are nothing more and just the best involuntary counter-arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy. stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terrible thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of the house is managed woman does not understand what food means, and she insists on being cook if woman had been a thinking creature, she should certainly, as cook for thousands of years, have discovered the most important physiological facts, and should likewise have got possession of the healing art through bad female cooks through the entire lack of reason in the kitchen the development of mankind has been longest retarded and most interfered with: even today matters are very little better. a word to high school girls. there are turns and casts of fancy, there are sentences, little handfuls of words, in which a whole culture, a whole society suddenly crystallises itself. among these is the incidental remark of madame de lambert to her son: mon ami, ne vous permettez jamais que des folies, qui vous feront grand plaisir the motherliest and wisest remark, by the way, that was ever addressed to a son. i have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what dante and goethe believed about woman the former when he sang, ella guardava suso, ed io in lei, and the latter when he interpreted it, the eternally feminine draws us aloft; for this is just what she believes of the eternally masculine. seven apophthegms for women how the longest ennui flees, when a man comes to our knees age, alas and science staid, furnish even weak virtue aid. sombre garb and silence meet: dress for every dame discreet. whom i thank when in my bliss god and my good tailoress young, a flower-decked cavern home; old, a dragon thence doth roam. noble title, leg that's fine, man as well: oh, were he mine speech in brief and sense in mass slippery for the jenny-ass woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds, which, losing their way, have come down among them from an elevation: as something delicate, fragile, wild, strange, sweet, and animating but as something also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away. to be mistaken in the fundamental problem of man and woman, to deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally hostile tension, to dream here perhaps of equal rights, equal training, equal claims and obligations: that is a typical sign of shallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved himself shallow at this dangerous spot shallow in instinct may generally be regarded as suspicious, nay more, as betrayed, as discovered; he will probably prove too short for all fundamental questions of life, future as well as present, and will be unable to descend into any of the depths. on the other hand, a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires, and has also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and harshness, and easily confounded with them, can only think of woman as orientals do: he must conceive of her as a possession, as confinable property, as a being predestined for service and accomplishing her mission therein he must take his stand in this matter upon the immense rationality of asia, upon the superiority of the instinct of asia, as the greeks did formerly; those best heirs and scholars of asia who, as is well known, with their increasing culture and amplitude of power, from homer to the time of pericles, became gradually stricter towards woman, in short, more oriental. how necessary, how logical, even how humanely desirable this was, let us consider for ourselves the weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so much respect by men as at present this belongs to the tendency and fundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as disrespectfulness to old age what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of this respect they want more, they learn to make claims, the tribute of respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights, indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is losing modesty. and let us immediately add that she is also losing taste. she is unlearning to fear man: but the woman who unlearns to fear sacrifices her most womanly instincts. that woman should venture forward when the fear-inspiring quality in man or more definitely, the man in man is no longer either desired or fully developed, is reasonable enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficult to understand is that precisely thereby woman deteriorates. this is what is happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military and aristocratic spirit, woman strives for the economic and legal independence of a clerk: woman as clerkess is inscribed on the portal of the modern society which is in course of formation. while she thus appropriates new rights, aspires to be master, and inscribes progress of woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite realises itself with terrible obviousness: woman retrogrades. since the french revolution the influence of woman in europe has declined in proportion as she has increased her rights and claims; and the emancipation of woman, insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves (and not only by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly instincts. there is stupidity in this movement, an almost masculine stupidity, of which a well-reared woman who is always a sensible woman might be heartily ashamed. to lose the intuition as to the ground upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise in the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man, perhaps even to the book, where formerly she kept herself in control and in refined, artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man's faith in a veiled, fundamentally different ideal in woman, something eternally, necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciously dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved, cared for, protected, and indulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and often pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of woman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still entails (as though slavery were a counter-argument, and not rather a condition of every higher culture, of every elevation of culture): what does all this betoken, if not a disintegration of womanly instincts, a defeminising certainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and corrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex, who advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate all the stupidities from which man in europe, european manliness, suffers, who would like to lower woman to general culture, indeed even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. here and there they wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers: as though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious or ludicrous to a profound and godless man; almost everywhere her nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music (our latest german music), and she is daily being made more hysterical and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of bearing robust children. they wish to cultivate her in general still more, and intend, as they say, to make the weaker sex strong by culture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that the cultivating of mankind and his weakening that is to say, the weakening, dissipating, and languishing of his force of will have always kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and influential women in the world (and lastly, the mother of napoleon) had just to thank their force of will and not their schoolmasters for their power and ascendancy over men. that which inspires respect in woman, and often enough fear also, is her nature, which is more natural than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning flexibility, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, her naivete in egoism, her untrainableness and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness, extent, and deviation of her desires and virtues. that which, in spite of fear, excites one's sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat, woman, is that she seems more afflicted, more vulnerable, more necessitous of love, and more condemned to disillusionment than any other creature. fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has hitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot already in tragedy, which rends while it delights what and all that is now to be at an end and the disenchantment of woman is in progress the tediousness of woman is slowly evolving oh europe europe we know the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee, from which danger is ever again threatening thee thy old fable might once more become history an immense stupidity might once again overmaster thee and carry thee away and no god concealed beneath it no only an idea, a modern idea chapter viii. peoples and countries i heard, once again for the first time, richard wagner's overture to the mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy, latter-day art, which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music as still living, in order that it may be understood: it is an honour to germans that such a pride did not miscalculate what flavours and forces, what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it it impresses us at one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter, and too modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it is not infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarse it has fire and courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-coloured skin of fruits which ripen too late. it flows broad and full: and suddenly there is a moment of inexplicable hesitation, like a gap that opens between cause and effect, an oppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but already it broadens and widens anew, the old stream of delight the most manifold delight, of old and new happiness; including especially the joy of the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his astonished, happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here employed, the new, newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art which he apparently betrays to us. all in all, however, no beauty, no south, nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing of grace, no dance, hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even, which is also emphasized, as though the artist wished to say to us: it is part of my intention; a cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily barbaric and ceremonious, a flirring of learned and venerable conceits and witticisms; something german in the best and worst sense of the word, something in the german style, manifold, formless, and inexhaustible; a certain german potency and super-plenitude of soul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the raffinements of decadence which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease there; a real, genuine token of the german soul, which is at the same time young and aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. this kind of music expresses best what i think of the germans: they belong to the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow they have as yet no today. we good europeans, we also have hours when we allow ourselves a warm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow views i have just given an example of it hours of national excitement, of patriotic anguish, and all other sorts of old-fashioned floods of sentiment. duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confines its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours in a considerable time: some in half a year, others in half a lifetime, according to the speed and strength with which they digest and change their material. indeed, i could think of sluggish, hesitating races, which even in our rapidly moving europe, would require half a century ere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and soil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say, to good europeanism. and while digressing on this possibility, i happen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two old patriots they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently spoke all the louder. he has as much, and knows as much, philosophy as a peasant or a corps-student, said the one he is still innocent. but what does that matter nowadays it is the age of the masses: they lie on their belly before everything that is massive. and so also in politicis. a statesman who rears up for them a new tower of babel, some monstrosity of empire and power, they call 'great' what does it matter that we more prudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or affair. supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position of being obliged henceforth to practise 'high politics,' for which they were by nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have to sacrifice their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and doubtful mediocrity; supposing a statesman were to condemn his people generally to 'practise politics,' when they have hitherto had something better to do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of the restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the essentially politics-practising nations; supposing such a statesman were to stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people, were to make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness, an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to depreciate their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences, make their minds narrow, and their tastes 'national' what a statesman who should do all this, which his people would have to do penance for throughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a statesman would be great, would he undoubtedly replied the other old patriot vehemently, otherwise he could not have done it it was mad perhaps to wish such a thing but perhaps everything great has been just as mad at its commencement misuse of words cried his interlocutor, contradictorily strong strong strong and mad not great the old men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their truths in each other's faces, but i, in my happiness and apartness, considered how soon a stronger one may become master of the strong, and also that there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a nation namely, in the deepening of another. whether we call it civilization, or humanising, or progress, which now distinguishes the european, whether we call it simply, without praise or blame, by the political formula the democratic movement in europe behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by such formulas, an immense physiological process goes on, which is ever extending the process of the assimilation of europeans, their increasing detachment from the conditions under which, climatically and hereditarily, united races originate, their increasing independence of every definite milieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself with equal demands on soul and body, that is to say, the slow emergence of an essentially super-national and nomadic species of man, who possesses, physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and power of adaptation as his typical distinction. this process of the evolving european, which can be retarded in its tempo by great relapses, but will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth the still-raging storm and stress of national sentiment pertains to it, and also the anarchism which is appearing at present this process will probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and panegyrists, the apostles of modern ideas, would least care to reckon. the same new conditions under which on an average a levelling and mediocrising of man will take place a useful, industrious, variously serviceable, and clever gregarious man are in the highest degree suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and attractive qualities. for, while the capacity for adaptation, which is every day trying changing conditions, and begins a new work with every generation, almost with every decade, makes the powerfulness of the type impossible; while the collective impression of such future europeans will probably be that of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very handy workmen who require a master, a commander, as they require their daily bread; while, therefore, the democratising of europe will tend to the production of a type prepared for slavery in the most subtle sense of the term: the strong man will necessarily in individual and exceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever been before owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling, owing to the immense variety of practice, art, and disguise. i meant to say that the democratising of europe is at the same time an involuntary arrangement for the rearing of tyrants taking the word in all its meanings, even in its most spiritual sense. i hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the constellation hercules: and i hope that the men on this earth will do like the sun. and we foremost, we good europeans there was a time when it was customary to call germans deep by way of distinction; but now that the most successful type of new germanism is covetous of quite other honours, and perhaps misses smartness in all that has depth, it is almost opportune and patriotic to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that commendation: in short, whether german depth is not at bottom something different and worse and something from which, thank god, we are on the point of successfully ridding ourselves. let us try, then, to relearn with regard to german depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose is a little vivisection of the german soul. the german soul is above all manifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super-imposed, rather than actually built: this is owing to its origin. a german who would embolden himself to assert: two souls, alas, dwell in my breast, would make a bad guess at the truth, or, more correctly, he would come far short of the truth about the number of souls. as a people made up of the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a preponderance of the pre-aryan element as the people of the centre in every sense of the term, the germans are more intangible, more ample, more contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more surprising, and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves: they escape definition, and are thereby alone the despair of the french. it is characteristic of the germans that the question: what is german never dies out among them. kotzebue certainly knew his germans well enough: we are known, they cried jubilantly to him but sand also thought he knew them. jean paul knew what he was doing when he declared himself incensed at fichte's lying but patriotic flatteries and exaggerations, but it is probable that goethe thought differently about germans from jean paul, even though he acknowledged him to be right with regard to fichte. it is a question what goethe really thought about the germans but about many things around him he never spoke explicitly, and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silence probably he had good reason for it. it is certain that it was not the wars of independence that made him look up more joyfully, any more than it was the french revolution, the event on account of which he reconstructed his faust, and indeed the whole problem of man, was the appearance of napoleon. there are words of goethe in which he condemns with impatient severity, as from a foreign land, that which germans take a pride in, he once defined the famous german turn of mind as indulgence towards its own and others' weaknesses. was he wrong it is characteristic of germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them. the german soul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves, hiding-places, and dungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm of the mysterious, the german is well acquainted with the bypaths to chaos. and as everything loves its symbol, so the german loves the clouds and all that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp, and shrouded, it seems to him that everything uncertain, undeveloped, self-displacing, and growing is deep. the german himself does not exist, he is becoming, he is developing himself. development is therefore the essentially german discovery and hit in the great domain of philosophical formulas, a ruling idea, which, together with german beer and german music, is labouring to germanise all europe. foreigners are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature at the basis of the german soul propounds to them (riddles which hegel systematised and richard wagner has in the end set to music). good-natured and spiteful such a juxtaposition, preposterous in the case of every other people, is unfortunately only too often justified in germany one has only to live for a while among swabians to know this the clumsiness of the german scholar and his social distastefulness agree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and nimble boldness, of which all the gods have learnt to be afraid. if any one wishes to see the german soul demonstrated ad oculos, let him only look at german taste, at german arts and manners what boorish indifference to taste how the noblest and the commonest stand there in juxtaposition how disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution of this soul the german drags at his soul, he drags at everything he experiences. he digests his events badly; he never gets done with them; and german depth is often only a difficult, hesitating digestion. and just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like what is convenient, so the german loves frankness and honesty; it is so convenient to be frank and honest this confidingness, this complaisance, this showing-the-cards of german honesty, is probably the most dangerous and most successful disguise which the german is up to nowadays: it is his proper mephistophelean art; with this he can still achieve much the german lets himself go, and thereby gazes with faithful, blue, empty german eyes and other countries immediately confound him with his dressing-gown i meant to say that, let german depth be what it will among ourselves alone we perhaps take the liberty to laugh at it we shall do well to continue henceforth to honour its appearance and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our old reputation as a people of depth for prussian smartness, and berlin wit and sand. it is wise for a people to pose, and let itself be regarded, as profound, clumsy, good-natured, honest, and foolish: it might even be profound to do so finally, we should do honour to our name we are not called the tiusche volk (deceptive people) for nothing.... the good old time is past, it sang itself out in mozart how happy are we that his rococo still speaks to us, that his good company, his tender enthusiasm, his childish delight in the chinese and its flourishes, his courtesy of heart, his longing for the elegant, the amorous, the tripping, the tearful, and his belief in the south, can still appeal to something left in us ah, some time or other it will be over with it but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with the intelligence and taste for beethoven for he was only the last echo of a break and transition in style, and not, like mozart, the last echo of a great european taste which had existed for centuries. beethoven is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly breaking down, and a future over-young soul that is always coming; there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal extravagant hope, the same light in which europe was bathed when it dreamed with rousseau, when it danced round the tree of liberty of the revolution, and finally almost fell down in adoration before napoleon. but how rapidly does this very sentiment now pale, how difficult nowadays is even the apprehension of this sentiment, how strangely does the language of rousseau, schiller, shelley, and byron sound to our ear, in whom collectively the same fate of europe was able to speak, which knew how to sing in beethoven whatever german music came afterwards, belongs to romanticism, that is to say, to a movement which, historically considered, was still shorter, more fleeting, and more superficial than that great interlude, the transition of europe from rousseau to napoleon, and to the rise of democracy. weber but what do we care nowadays for freischutz and oberon or marschner's hans heiling and vampyre or even wagner's tannhauser that is extinct, although not yet forgotten music. this whole music of romanticism, besides, was not noble enough, was not musical enough, to maintain its position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses; from the beginning it was second-rate music, which was little thought of by genuine musicians. it was different with felix mendelssohn, that halcyon master, who, on account of his lighter, purer, happier soul, quickly acquired admiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautiful episode of german music. but with regard to robert schumann, who took things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the first he was the last that founded a school, do we not now regard it as a satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very romanticism of schumann's has been surmounted schumann, fleeing into the saxon switzerland of his soul, with a half werther-like, half jean-paul-like nature (assuredly not like beethoven assuredly not like byron ) his manfred music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of injustice; schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a petty taste (that is to say, a dangerous propensity doubly dangerous among germans for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings), going constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble weakling who revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the beginning a sort of girl and noli me tangere this schumann was already merely a german event in music, and no longer a european event, as beethoven had been, as in a still greater degree mozart had been; with schumann german music was threatened with its greatest danger, that of losing the voice for the soul of europe and sinking into a merely national affair. what a torture are books written in german to a reader who has a third ear how indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance, which germans call a book and even the german who reads books how lazily, how reluctantly, how badly he reads how many germans know, and consider it obligatory to know, that there is art in every good sentence art which must be divined, if the sentence is to be understood if there is a misunderstanding about its tempo, for instance, the sentence itself is misunderstood that one must not be doubtful about the rhythm-determining syllables, that one should feel the breaking of the too-rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm, that one should lend a fine and patient ear to every staccato and every rubato, that one should divine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs, and how delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of their arrangement who among book-reading germans is complaisant enough to recognize such duties and requirements, and to listen to so much art and intention in language after all, one just has no ear for it; and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard, and the most delicate artistry is as it were squandered on the deaf. these were my thoughts when i noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in the art of prose-writing have been confounded: one, whose words drop down hesitatingly and coldly, as from the roof of a damp cave he counts on their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates his language like a flexible sword, and from his arm down into his toes feels the dangerous bliss of the quivering, over-sharp blade, which wishes to bite, hiss, and cut. how little the german style has to do with harmony and with the ear, is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves write badly. the german does not read aloud, he does not read for the ear, but only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer for the time. in antiquity when a man read which was seldom enough he read something to himself, and in a loud voice; they were surprised when any one read silently, and sought secretly the reason of it. in a loud voice: that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, and variations of key and changes of tempo, in which the ancient public world took delight. the laws of the written style were then the same as those of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the surprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx; partly on the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lungs. in the ancient sense, a period is above all a physiological whole, inasmuch as it is comprised in one breath. such periods as occur in demosthenes and cicero, swelling twice and sinking twice, and all in one breath, were pleasures to the men of antiquity, who knew by their own schooling how to appreciate the virtue therein, the rareness and the difficulty in the deliverance of such a period; we have really no right to the big period, we modern men, who are short of breath in every sense those ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti in speaking, consequently connoisseurs, consequently critics they thus brought their orators to the highest pitch; in the same manner as in the last century, when all italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song (and with it also the art of melody) reached its elevation. in germany, however (until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings), there was properly speaking only one kind of public and approximately artistical discourse that delivered from the pulpit. the preacher was the only one in germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a sentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone had a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for reasons are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom attained by a german, or almost always too late. the masterpiece of german prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its greatest preacher: the bible has hitherto been the best german book. compared with luther's bible, almost everything else is merely literature something which has not grown in germany, and therefore has not taken and does not take root in german hearts, as the bible has done. there are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all engenders and seeks to engender, and another which willingly lets itself be fructified and brings forth. and similarly, among the gifted nations, there are those on whom the woman's problem of pregnancy has devolved, and the secret task of forming, maturing, and perfecting the greeks, for instance, were a nation of this kind, and so are the french; and others which have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of life like the jews, the romans, and, in all modesty be it asked: like the germans nations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and irresistibly forced out of themselves, amorous and longing for foreign races (for such as let themselves be fructified), and withal imperious, like everything conscious of being full of generative force, and consequently empowered by the grace of god. these two kinds of geniuses seek each other like man and woman; but they also misunderstand each other like man and woman. every nation has its own tartuffery, and calls that its virtue. one does not know cannot know, the best that is in one. what europe owes to the jews many things, good and bad, and above all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst: the grand style in morality, the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands, of infinite significations, the whole romanticism and sublimity of moral questionableness and consequently just the most attractive, ensnaring, and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to life, in the aftersheen of which the sky of our european culture, its evening sky, now glows perhaps glows out. for this, we artists among the spectators and philosophers, are grateful to the jews. it must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and disturbances in short, slight attacks of stupidity pass over the spirit of a people that suffers and wants to suffer from national nervous fever and political ambition: for instance, among present-day germans there is alternately the anti-french folly, the anti-semitic folly, the anti-polish folly, the christian-romantic folly, the wagnerian folly, the teutonic folly, the prussian folly (just look at those poor historians, the sybels and treitschkes, and their closely bandaged heads), and whatever else these little obscurations of the german spirit and conscience may be called. may it be forgiven me that i, too, when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground, did not remain wholly exempt from the disease, but like every one else, began to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern me the first symptom of political infection. about the jews, for instance, listen to the following: i have never yet met a german who was favourably inclined to the jews; and however decided the repudiation of actual anti-semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men, this prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the sentiment itself, but only against its dangerous excess, and especially against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of sentiment; on this point we must not deceive ourselves. that germany has amply sufficient jews, that the german stomach, the german blood, has difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing only of this quantity of jew as the italian, the frenchman, and the englishman have done by means of a stronger digestion: that is the unmistakable declaration and language of a general instinct, to which one must listen and according to which one must act. let no more jews come in and shut the doors, especially towards the east (also towards austria) thus commands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and uncertain, so that it could be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by a stronger race. the jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest, toughest, and purest race at present living in europe, they know how to succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better than under favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one would like nowadays to label as vices owing above all to a resolute faith which does not need to be ashamed before modern ideas, they alter only, when they do alter, in the same way that the russian empire makes its conquest as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of yesterday namely, according to the principle, as slowly as possible a thinker who has the future of europe at heart, will, in all his perspectives concerning the future, calculate upon the jews, as he will calculate upon the russians, as above all the surest and likeliest factors in the great play and battle of forces. that which is at present called a nation in europe, and is really rather a res facta than nata (indeed, sometimes confusingly similar to a res ficta et picta), is in every case something evolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet a race, much less such a race aere perennus, as the jews are such nations should most carefully avoid all hot-headed rivalry and hostility it is certain that the jews, if they desired or if they were driven to it, as the anti-semites seem to wish could now have the ascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over europe, that they are not working and planning for that end is equally certain. meanwhile, they rather wish and desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and absorbed by europe, they long to be finally settled, authorized, and respected somewhere, and wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the wandering jew, and one should certainly take account of this impulse and tendency, and make advances to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation of the jewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful and fair to banish the anti-semitic bawlers out of the country. one should make advances with all prudence, and with selection, pretty much as the english nobility do it stands to reason that the more powerful and strongly marked types of new germanism could enter into relation with the jews with the least hesitation, for instance, the nobleman officer from the prussian border it would be interesting in many ways to see whether the genius for money and patience (and especially some intellect and intellectuality sadly lacking in the place referred to) could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of commanding and obeying for both of which the country in question has now a classic reputation but here it is expedient to break off my festal discourse and my sprightly teutonomania for i have already reached my serious topic, the european problem, as i understand it, the rearing of a new ruling caste for europe. they are not a philosophical race the english: bacon represents an attack on the philosophical spirit generally, hobbes, hume, and locke, an abasement, and a depreciation of the idea of a philosopher for more than a century. it was against hume that kant uprose and raised himself; it was locke of whom schelling rightly said, je meprise locke; in the struggle against the english mechanical stultification of the world, hegel and schopenhauer (along with goethe) were of one accord; the two hostile brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different directions towards the opposite poles of german thought, and thereby wronged each other as only brothers will do. what is lacking in england, and has always been lacking, that half-actor and rhetorician knew well enough, the absurd muddle-head, carlyle, who sought to conceal under passionate grimaces what he knew about himself: namely, what was lacking in carlyle real power of intellect, real depth of intellectual perception, in short, philosophy. it is characteristic of such an unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to christianity they need its discipline for moralizing and humanizing. the englishman, more gloomy, sensual, headstrong, and brutal than the german is for that very reason, as the baser of the two, also the most pious: he has all the more need of christianity. to finer nostrils, this english christianity itself has still a characteristic english taint of spleen and alcoholic excess, for which, owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidote the finer poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning is in fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people, a step towards spiritualization. the english coarseness and rustic demureness is still most satisfactorily disguised by christian pantomime, and by praying and psalm-singing (or, more correctly, it is thereby explained and differently expressed); and for the herd of drunkards and rakes who formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of methodism (and more recently as the salvation army), a penitential fit may really be the relatively highest manifestation of humanity to which they can be elevated: so much may reasonably be admitted. that, however, which offends even in the humanest englishman is his lack of music, to speak figuratively (and also literally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in the movements of his soul and body; indeed, not even the desire for rhythm and dance, for music. listen to him speaking; look at the most beautiful englishwoman walking in no country on earth are there more beautiful doves and swans; finally, listen to them singing but i ask too much... there are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds, because they are best adapted for them, there are truths which only possess charms and seductive power for mediocre spirits: one is pushed to this probably unpleasant conclusion, now that the influence of respectable but mediocre englishmen i may mention darwin, john stuart mill, and herbert spencer begins to gain the ascendancy in the middle-class region of european taste. indeed, who could doubt that it is a useful thing for such minds to have the ascendancy for a time it would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently soaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting many little common facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions, they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards those who are the rules. after all, they have more to do than merely to perceive: in effect, they have to be something new, they have to signify something new, they have to represent new values the gulf between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater, and also more mysterious, than one thinks: the capable man in the grand style, the creator, will possibly have to be an ignorant person; while on the other hand, for scientific discoveries like those of darwin, a certain narrowness, aridity, and industrious carefulness (in short, something english) may not be unfavourable for arriving at them. finally, let it not be forgotten that the english, with their profound mediocrity, brought about once before a general depression of european intelligence. what is called modern ideas, or the ideas of the eighteenth century, or french ideas that, consequently, against which the german mind rose up with profound disgust is of english origin, there is no doubt about it. the french were only the apes and actors of these ideas, their best soldiers, and likewise, alas their first and profoundest victims; for owing to the diabolical anglomania of modern ideas, the ame francais has in the end become so thin and emaciated, that at present one recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its profound, passionate strength, its inventive excellency, almost with disbelief. one must, however, maintain this verdict of historical justice in a determined manner, and defend it against present prejudices and appearances: the european noblesse of sentiment, taste, and manners, taking the word in every high sense is the work and invention of france; the european ignobleness, the plebeianism of modern ideas is england's work and invention. even at present france is still the seat of the most intellectual and refined culture of europe, it is still the high school of taste; but one must know how to find this france of taste. he who belongs to it keeps himself well concealed: they may be a small number in whom it lives and is embodied, besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon the strongest legs, in part fatalists, hypochondriacs, invalids, in part persons over-indulged, over-refined, such as have the ambition to conceal themselves. they have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic bourgeois. in fact, a besotted and brutalized france at present sprawls in the foreground it recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste, and at the same time of self-admiration, at the funeral of victor hugo. there is also something else common to them: a predilection to resist intellectual germanizing and a still greater inability to do so in this france of intellect, which is also a france of pessimism, schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more indigenous than he has ever been in germany; not to speak of heinrich heine, who has long ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists of paris; or of hegel, who at present, in the form of taine the first of living historians exercises an almost tyrannical influence. as regards richard wagner, however, the more french music learns to adapt itself to the actual needs of the ame moderne, the more will it wagnerite; one can safely predict that beforehand, it is already taking place sufficiently there are, however, three things which the french can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession, and as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority in europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary germanizing and vulgarizing of taste. firstly, the capacity for artistic emotion, for devotion to form, for which the expression, l'art pour l'art, along with numerous others, has been invented: such capacity has not been lacking in france for three centuries; and owing to its reverence for the small number, it has again and again made a sort of chamber music of literature possible, which is sought for in vain elsewhere in europe. the second thing whereby the french can lay claim to a superiority over europe is their ancient, many-sided, moralistic culture, owing to which one finds on an average, even in the petty romanciers of the newspapers and chance boulevardiers de paris, a psychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one has no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself ) in germany. the germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite thereto, which, as we have said, france has not grudged: those who call the germans naive on that account give them commendation for a defect. (as the opposite of the german inexperience and innocence in voluptate psychologica, which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness of german intercourse, and as the most successful expression of genuine french curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate thrills, henri beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory and forerunning man, who, with a napoleonic tempo, traversed his europe, in fact, several centuries of the european soul, as a surveyor and discoverer thereof: it has required two generations to overtake him one way or other, to divine long afterwards some of the riddles that perplexed and enraptured him this strange epicurean and man of interrogation, the last great psychologist of france). there is yet a third claim to superiority: in the french character there is a successful half-way synthesis of the north and south, which makes them comprehend many things, and enjoins upon them other things, which an englishman can never comprehend. their temperament, turned alternately to and from the south, in which from time to time the provencal and ligurian blood froths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern grey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty of blood our german infirmity of taste, for the excessive prevalence of which at the present moment, blood and iron, that is to say high politics, has with great resolution been prescribed (according to a dangerous healing art, which bids me wait and wait, but not yet hope). there is also still in france a pre-understanding and ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men, who are too comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism, and know how to love the south when in the north and the north when in the south the born midlanders, the good europeans. for them bizet has made music, this latest genius, who has seen a new beauty and seduction, who has discovered a piece of the south in music. i hold that many precautions should be taken against german music. suppose a person loves the south as i love it as a great school of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills, as a boundless solar profusion and effulgence which o'erspreads a sovereign existence believing in itself well, such a person will learn to be somewhat on his guard against german music, because, in injuring his taste anew, it will also injure his health anew. such a southerner, a southerner not by origin but by belief, if he should dream of the future of music, must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the north; and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and perhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-german music, which does not fade, pale, and die away, as all german music does, at the sight of the blue, wanton sea and the mediterranean clearness of sky a super-european music, which holds its own even in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert, whose soul is akin to the palm-tree, and can be at home and can roam with big, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey... i could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew nothing more of good and evil; only that here and there perhaps some sailor's home-sickness, some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might sweep lightly over it; an art which, from the far distance, would see the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible moral world fleeing towards it, and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to receive such belated fugitives. owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze has induced and still induces among the nations of europe, owing also to the short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with the help of this craze, are at present in power, and do not suspect to what extent the disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude policy owing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable at present, the most unmistakable signs that europe wishes to be one, are now overlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted. with all the more profound and large-minded men of this century, the real general tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way for that new synthesis, and tentatively to anticipate the european of the future; only in their simulations, or in their weaker moments, in old age perhaps, did they belong to the fatherlands they only rested from themselves when they became patriots. i think of such men as napoleon, goethe, beethoven, stendhal, heinrich heine, schopenhauer: it must not be taken amiss if i also count richard wagner among them, about whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings (geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves), still less, of course, by the unseemly noise with which he is now resisted and opposed in france: the fact remains, nevertheless, that richard wagner and the later french romanticism of the forties, are most closely and intimately related to one another. they are akin, fundamentally akin, in all the heights and depths of their requirements; it is europe, the one europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly, outwards and upwards, in their multifarious and boisterous art whither into a new light towards a new sun but who would attempt to express accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not express distinctly it is certain that the same storm and stress tormented them, that they sought in the same manner, these last great seekers all of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears the first artists of universal literary culture for the most part even themselves writers, poets, intermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses (wagner, as musician is reckoned among painters, as poet among musicians, as artist generally among actors); all of them fanatics for expression at any cost i specially mention delacroix, the nearest related to wagner; all of them great discoverers in the realm of the sublime, also of the loathsome and dreadful, still greater discoverers in effect, in display, in the art of the show-shop; all of them talented far beyond their genius, out and out virtuosi, with mysterious accesses to all that seduces, allures, constrains, and upsets; born enemies of logic and of the straight line, hankering after the strange, the exotic, the monstrous, the crooked, and the self-contradictory; as men, tantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus, who knew themselves to be incapable of a noble tempo or of a lento in life and action think of balzac, for instance, unrestrained workers, almost destroying themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners, ambitious and insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all of them finally shattering and sinking down at the christian cross (and with right and reason, for who of them would have been sufficiently profound and sufficiently original for an anti-christian philosophy ); on the whole, a boldly daring, splendidly overbearing, high-flying, and aloft-up-dragging class of higher men, who had first to teach their century and it is the century of the masses the conception higher man.... let the german friends of richard wagner advise together as to whether there is anything purely german in the wagnerian art, or whether its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from super-german sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be underrated how indispensable paris was to the development of his type, which the strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most decisive time and how the whole style of his proceedings, of his self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in sight of the french socialistic original. on a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be found, to the honour of richard wagner's german nature, that he has acted in everything with more strength, daring, severity, and elevation than a nineteenth-century frenchman could have done owing to the circumstance that we germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the french; perhaps even the most remarkable creation of richard wagner is not only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and inimitable to the whole latter-day latin race: the figure of siegfried, that very free man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too cheerful, too healthy, too anti-catholic for the taste of old and mellow civilized nations. he may even have been a sin against romanticism, this anti-latin siegfried: well, wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old sad days, when anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into politics he began, with the religious vehemence peculiar to him, to preach, at least, the way to rome, if not to walk therein. that these last words may not be misunderstood, i will call to my aid a few powerful rhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what i mean what i mean counter to the last wagner and his parsifal music: is this our mode from german heart came this vexed ululating from german body, this self-lacerating is ours this priestly hand-dilation, this incense-fuming exaltation is ours this faltering, falling, shambling, this quite uncertain ding-dong-dangling this sly nun-ogling, ave-hour-bell ringing, this wholly false enraptured heaven-o'erspringing is this our mode think well ye still wait for admission for what ye hear is rome rome's faith by intuition chapter ix. what is noble every elevation of the type man, has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society and so it will always be a society believing in a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human beings, and requiring slavery in some form or other. without the pathos of distance, such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes, out of the constant out-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste on subordinates and instruments, and out of their equally constant practice of obeying and commanding, of keeping down and keeping at a distance that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen, the longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself, the formation of ever higher, rarer, further, more extended, more comprehensive states, in short, just the elevation of the type man, the continued self-surmounting of man, to use a moral formula in a supermoral sense. to be sure, one must not resign oneself to any humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of an aristocratic society (that is to say, of the preliminary condition for the elevation of the type man): the truth is hard. let us acknowledge unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has originated men with a still natural nature, barbarians in every terrible sense of the word, men of prey, still in possession of unbroken strength of will and desire for power, threw themselves upon weaker, more moral, more peaceful races (perhaps trading or cattle-rearing communities), or upon old mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering out in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity. at the commencement, the noble caste was always the barbarian caste: their superiority did not consist first of all in their physical, but in their psychical power they were more complete men (which at every point also implies the same as more complete beasts). corruption as the indication that anarchy threatens to break out among the instincts, and that the foundation of the emotions, called life, is convulsed is something radically different according to the organization in which it manifests itself. when, for instance, an aristocracy like that of france at the beginning of the revolution, flung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself to an excess of its moral sentiments, it was corruption: it was really only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuries, by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a function of royalty (in the end even to its decoration and parade-dress). the essential thing, however, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard itself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth, but as the significance and highest justification thereof that it should therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion of individuals, who, for its sake, must be suppressed and reduced to imperfect men, to slaves and instruments. its fundamental belief must be precisely that society is not allowed to exist for its own sake, but only as a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties, and in general to a higher existence: like those sun-seeking climbing plants in java they are called sipo matador, which encircle an oak so long and so often with their arms, until at last, high above it, but supported by it, they can unfold their tops in the open light, and exhibit their happiness. to refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from exploitation, and put one's will on a par with that of others: this may result in a certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary conditions are given (namely, the actual similarity of the individuals in amount of force and degree of worth, and their co-relation within one organization). as soon, however, as one wished to take this principle more generally, and if possible even as the fundamental principle of society, it would immediately disclose what it really is namely, a will to the denial of life, a principle of dissolution and decay. here one must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental weakness: life itself is essentially appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of peculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest, exploitation; but why should one for ever use precisely these words on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped even the organization within which, as was previously supposed, the individuals treat each other as equal it takes place in every healthy aristocracy must itself, if it be a living and not a dying organization, do all that towards other bodies, which the individuals within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the incarnated will to power, it will endeavour to grow, to gain ground, attract to itself and acquire ascendancy not owing to any morality or immorality, but because it lives, and because life is precisely will to power. on no point, however, is the ordinary consciousness of europeans more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter, people now rave everywhere, even under the guise of science, about coming conditions of society in which the exploiting character is to be absent that sounds to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should refrain from all organic functions. exploitation does not belong to a depraved, or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of the living being as a primary organic function, it is a consequence of the intrinsic will to power, which is precisely the will to life granting that as a theory this is a novelty as a reality it is the fundamental fact of all history let us be so far honest towards ourselves in a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, i found certain traits recurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until finally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical distinction was brought to light. there is master-morality and slave-morality, i would at once add, however, that in all higher and mixed civilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of the two moralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and mutual misunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close juxtaposition even in the same man, within one soul. the distinctions of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly conscious of being different from the ruled or among the ruled class, the slaves and dependents of all sorts. in the first case, when it is the rulers who determine the conception good, it is the exalted, proud disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that which determines the order of rank. the noble type of man separates from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud disposition displays itself he despises them. let it at once be noted that in this first kind of morality the antithesis good and bad means practically the same as noble and despicable, the antithesis good and evil is of a different origin. the cowardly, the timid, the insignificant, and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised; moreover, also, the distrustful, with their constrained glances, the self-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused, the mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars: it is a fundamental belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful. we truthful ones the nobility in ancient greece called themselves. it is obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first applied to men; and were only derivatively and at a later period applied to actions; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals start with questions like, why have sympathetic actions been praised the noble type of man regards himself as a determiner of values; he does not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: what is injurious to me is injurious in itself; he knows that it is he himself only who confers honour on things; he is a creator of values. he honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals self-glorification. in the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude, of power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow: the noble man also helps the unfortunate, but not or scarcely out of pity, but rather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. the noble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power over himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has reverence for all that is severe and hard. wotan placed a hard heart in my breast, says an old scandinavian saga: it is thus rightly expressed from the soul of a proud viking. such a type of man is even proud of not being made for sympathy; the hero of the saga therefore adds warningly: he who has not a hard heart when young, will never have one. the noble and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality which sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others, or in desinteressement, the characteristic of the moral; faith in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards selflessness, belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the warm heart. it is the powerful who know how to honour, it is their art, their domain for invention. the profound reverence for age and for tradition all law rests on this double reverence, the belief and prejudice in favour of ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of the powerful; and if, reversely, men of modern ideas believe almost instinctively in progress and the future, and are more and more lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these ideas has complacently betrayed itself thereby. a morality of the ruling class, however, is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day taste in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's equals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank, towards all that is foreign, just as seems good to one, or as the heart desires, and in any case beyond good and evil: it is here that sympathy and similar sentiments can have a place. the ability and obligation to exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge both only within the circle of equals, artfulness in retaliation, raffinement of the idea in friendship, a certain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance in fact, in order to be a good friend): all these are typical characteristics of the noble morality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of modern ideas, and is therefore at present difficult to realize, and also to unearth and disclose. it is otherwise with the second type of morality, slave-morality. supposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering, the unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should moralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of man will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together with his situation. the slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the powerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a refinement of distrust of everything good that is there honoured he would fain persuade himself that the very happiness there is not genuine. on the other hand, those qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are brought into prominence and flooded with light; it is here that sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence, humility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the most useful qualities, and almost the only means of supporting the burden of existence. slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility. here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis good and evil: power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil, a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do not admit of being despised. according to slave-morality, therefore, the evil man arouses fear; according to master-morality, it is precisely the good man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is regarded as the despicable being. the contrast attains its maximum when, in accordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality, a shade of depreciation it may be slight and well-intentioned at last attaches itself to the good man of this morality; because, according to the servile mode of thought, the good man must in any case be the safe man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little stupid, un bonhomme. everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy, language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words good and stupid. a last fundamental difference: the desire for freedom, the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating. hence we can understand without further detail why love as a passion it is our european specialty must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its invention is due to the provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant, ingenious men of the gai saber, to whom europe owes so much, and almost owes itself. vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for a noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another kind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. the problem for him is to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of themselves which they themselves do not possess and consequently also do not deserve, and who yet believe in this good opinion afterwards. this seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so self-disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable, that he would like to consider vanity an exception, and is doubtful about it in most cases when it is spoken of. he will say, for instance: i may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others precisely as i rate it: that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit, or, in most cases, that which is called 'humility,' and also 'modesty'). or he will even say: for many reasons i can delight in the good opinion of others, perhaps because i love and honour them, and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion, perhaps because the good opinion of others, even in cases where i do not share it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness: all this, however, is not vanity. the man of noble character must first bring it home forcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history, that, from time immemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary man was only that which he passed for: not being at all accustomed to fix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value than that which his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar right of masters to create values). it may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary atavism, that the ordinary man, even at present, is still always waiting for an opinion about himself, and then instinctively submitting himself to it; yet by no means only to a good opinion, but also to a bad and unjust one (think, for instance, of the greater part of the self-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn from their confessors, and which in general the believing christian learns from his church). in fact, conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order (and its cause, the blending of the blood of masters and slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves, will now be more and more encouraged and extended; but it has at all times an older, ampler, and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it and in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger. the vain person rejoices over every good opinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point of view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjects himself to both, he feels himself subjected to both, by that oldest instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him. it is the slave in the vain man's blood, the remains of the slave's craftiness and how much of the slave is still left in woman, for instance which seeks to seduce to good opinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions, as though he had not called them forth. and to repeat it again: vanity is an atavism. a species originates, and a type becomes established and strong in the long struggle with essentially constant unfavourable conditions. on the other hand, it is known by the experience of breeders that species which receive super-abundant nourishment, and in general a surplus of protection and care, immediately tend in the most marked way to develop variations, and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in monstrous vices). now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say an ancient greek polis, or venice, as a voluntary or involuntary contrivance for the purpose of rearing human beings; there are there men beside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who want to make their species prevail, chiefly because they must prevail, or else run the terrible danger of being exterminated. the favour, the super-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which variations are fostered; the species needs itself as species, as something which, precisely by virtue of its hardness, its uniformity, and simplicity of structure, can in general prevail and make itself permanent in constant struggle with its neighbours, or with rebellious or rebellion-threatening vassals. the most varied experience teaches it what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that it still exists, in spite of all gods and men, and has hitherto been victorious: these qualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone it develops to maturity. it does so with severity, indeed it desires severity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education of youth, in the control of women, in the marriage customs, in the relations of old and young, in the penal laws (which have an eye only for the degenerating): it counts intolerance itself among the virtues, under the name of justice. a type with few, but very marked features, a species of severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and reticent men (and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and nuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the vicissitudes of generations; the constant struggle with uniform unfavourable conditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a type becoming stable and hard. finally, however, a happy state of things results, the enormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more enemies among the neighbouring peoples, and the means of life, even of the enjoyment of life, are present in superabundance. with one stroke the bond and constraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as necessary, as a condition of existence if it would continue, it can only do so as a form of luxury, as an archaizing taste. variations, whether they be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or deteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in the greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individual and detach himself. at this turning-point of history there manifest themselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving, a kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary decay and self-destruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms, which strive with one another for sun and light, and can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality. it was this morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously, which bent the bow in so threatening a manner: it is now out of date, it is getting out of date. the dangerous and disquieting point has been reached when the greater, more manifold, more comprehensive life is lived beyond the old morality; the individual stands out, and is obliged to have recourse to his own law-giving, his own arts and artifices for self-preservation, self-elevation, and self-deliverance. nothing but new whys, nothing but new hows, no common formulas any longer, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay, deterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled, the genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad, a portentous simultaneousness of spring and autumn, full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still inexhausted, still unwearied corruption. danger is again present, the mother of morality, great danger; this time shifted into the individual, into the neighbour and friend, into the street, into their own child, into their own heart, into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and volitions. what will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have to preach they discover, these sharp onlookers and loafers, that the end is quickly approaching, that everything around them decays and produces decay, that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow, except one species of man, the incurably mediocre. the mediocre alone have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves they will be the men of the future, the sole survivors; be like them become mediocre is now the only morality which has still a significance, which still obtains a hearing. but it is difficult to preach this morality of mediocrity it can never avow what it is and what it desires it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly love it will have difficulty in concealing its irony there is an instinct for rank, which more than anything else is already the sign of a high rank; there is a delight in the nuances of reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits. the refinement, goodness, and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test when something passes by that is of the highest rank, but is not yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches and incivilities: something that goes its way like a living touchstone, undistinguished, undiscovered, and tentative, perhaps voluntarily veiled and disguised. he whose task and practice it is to investigate souls, will avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine the ultimate value of a soul, the unalterable, innate order of rank to which it belongs: he will test it by its instinct for reverence. difference engendre haine: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like dirty water, when any holy vessel, any jewel from closed shrines, any book bearing the marks of great destiny, is brought before it; while on the other hand, there is an involuntary silence, a hesitation of the eye, a cessation of all gestures, by which it is indicated that a soul feels the nearness of what is worthiest of respect. the way in which, on the whole, the reverence for the bible has hitherto been maintained in europe, is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of manners which europe owes to christianity: books of such profoundness and supreme significance require for their protection an external tyranny of authority, in order to acquire the period of thousands of years which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them. much has been achieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses (the shallow-pates and the boobies of every kind) that they are not allowed to touch everything, that there are holy experiences before which they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand it is almost their highest advance towards humanity. on the contrary, in the so-called cultured classes, the believers in modern ideas, nothing is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame, the easy insolence of eye and hand with which they touch, taste, and finger everything; and it is possible that even yet there is more relative nobility of taste, and more tact for reverence among the people, among the lower classes of the people, especially among peasants, than among the newspaper-reading demimonde of intellect, the cultured class. it cannot be effaced from a man's soul what his ancestors have preferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligent economizers attached to a desk and a cash-box, modest and citizen-like in their desires, modest also in their virtues; or whether they were accustomed to commanding from morning till night, fond of rude pleasures and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities; or whether, finally, at one time or another, they have sacrificed old privileges of birth and possession, in order to live wholly for their faith for their god, as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience, which blushes at every compromise. it is quite impossible for a man not to have the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his constitution, whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary. this is the problem of race. granted that one knows something of the parents, it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kind of offensive incontinence, any kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy self-vaunting the three things which together have constituted the genuine plebeian type in all times such must pass over to the child, as surely as bad blood; and with the help of the best education and culture one will only succeed in deceiving with regard to such heredity. and what else does education and culture try to do nowadays in our very democratic, or rather, very plebeian age, education and culture must be essentially the art of deceiving deceiving with regard to origin, with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul. an educator who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else, and called out constantly to his pupils: be true be natural show yourselves as you are even such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time to have recourse to the furca of horace, naturam expellere: with what results plebeianism usque recurret. [footnote: horace's epistles, i. x.] at the risk of displeasing innocent ears, i submit that egoism belongs to the essence of a noble soul, i mean the unalterable belief that to a being such as we, other beings must naturally be in subjection, and have to sacrifice themselves. the noble soul accepts the fact of his egoism without question, and also without consciousness of harshness, constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something that may have its basis in the primary law of things: if he sought a designation for it he would say: it is justice itself. he acknowledges under certain circumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that there are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this question of rank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged ones with the same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect, which he enjoys in intercourse with himself in accordance with an innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand. it is an additional instance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation in intercourse with his equals every star is a similar egoist; he honours himself in them, and in the rights which he concedes to them, he has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights, as the essence of all intercourse, belongs also to the natural condition of things. the noble soul gives as he takes, prompted by the passionate and sensitive instinct of requital, which is at the root of his nature. the notion of favour has, inter pares, neither significance nor good repute; there may be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one from above, and of drinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for those arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude. his egoism hinders him here: in general, he looks aloft unwillingly he looks either forward, horizontally and deliberately, or downwards he knows that he is on a height. one can only truly esteem him who does not look out for himself. goethe to rath schlosser. the chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children: siao-sin (make thy heart small). this is the essentially fundamental tendency in latter-day civilizations. i have no doubt that an ancient greek, also, would first of all remark the self-dwarfing in us europeans of today in this respect alone we should immediately be distasteful to him. what, after all, is ignobleness words are vocal symbols for ideas; ideas, however, are more or less definite mental symbols for frequently returning and concurring sensations, for groups of sensations. it is not sufficient to use the same words in order to understand one another: we must also employ the same words for the same kind of internal experiences, we must in the end have experiences in common. on this account the people of one nation understand one another better than those belonging to different nations, even when they use the same language; or rather, when people have lived long together under similar conditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there originates therefrom an entity that understands itself namely, a nation. in all souls a like number of frequently recurring experiences have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: about these matters people understand one another rapidly and always more rapidly the history of language is the history of a process of abbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension people always unite closer and closer. the greater the danger, the greater is the need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary; not to misunderstand one another in danger that is what cannot at all be dispensed with in intercourse. also in all loves and friendships one has the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery has been made that in using the same words, one of the two parties has feelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears different from those of the other. (the fear of the eternal misunderstanding: that is the good genius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from too hasty attachments, to which sense and heart prompt them and not some schopenhauerian genius of the species ) whichever groups of sensations within a soul awaken most readily, begin to speak, and give the word of command these decide as to the general order of rank of its values, and determine ultimately its list of desirable things. a man's estimates of value betray something of the structure of his soul, and wherein it sees its conditions of life, its intrinsic needs. supposing now that necessity has from all time drawn together only such men as could express similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbols, it results on the whole that the easy communicability of need, which implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and common experiences, must have been the most potent of all the forces which have hitherto operated upon mankind. the more similar, the more ordinary people, have always had and are still having the advantage; the more select, more refined, more unique, and difficultly comprehensible, are liable to stand alone; they succumb to accidents in their isolation, and seldom propagate themselves. one must appeal to immense opposing forces, in order to thwart this natural, all-too-natural progressus in simile, the evolution of man to the similar, the ordinary, the average, the gregarious to the ignoble the more a psychologist a born, an unavoidable psychologist and soul-diviner turns his attention to the more select cases and individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy: he needs sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. for the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a rule always before one's eyes. the manifold torment of the psychologist who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then discovers almost repeatedly throughout all history, this universal inner desperateness of higher men, this eternal too late in every sense may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at self-destruction of his going to ruin himself. one may perceive in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and incisiveness from what his business has laid upon his conscience. the fear of his memory is peculiar to him. he is easily silenced by the judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour, admire, love, and glorify, where he has perceived or he even conceals his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. perhaps the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely where he has learnt great sympathy, together with great contempt, the multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt great reverence reverence for great men and marvelous animals, for the sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland, the earth, the dignity of mankind, and one's own self, to whom one points the young, and in view of whom one educates them. and who knows but in all great instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshipped a god, and that the god was only a poor sacrificial animal success has always been the greatest liar and the work itself is a success; the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in their creations until they are unrecognizable; the work of the artist, of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is reputed to have created it; the great men, as they are reverenced, are poor little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical values spurious coinage prevails. those great poets, for example, such as byron, musset, poe, leopardi, kleist, gogol (i do not venture to mention much greater names, but i have them in my mind), as they now appear, and were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous, and childish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust; with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking revenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the will-o'-the-wisps around the swamps, and pretend to be stars the people then call them idealists, often struggling with protracted disgust, with an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes them cold, and obliges them to languish for gloria and devour faith as it is out of the hands of intoxicated adulators: what a torment these great artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once found them out it is thus conceivable that it is just from woman who is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also unfortunately eager to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers that they have learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted sympathy, which the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand, and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. this sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would like to believe that love can do everything it is the superstition peculiar to her. alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor, helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love is he finds that it rather destroys than saves it is possible that under the holy fable and travesty of the life of jesus there is hidden one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of knowledge about love: the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that never had enough of any human love, that demanded love, that demanded inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible outbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor soul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send thither those who would not love him and that at last, enlightened about human love, had to invent a god who is entire love, entire capacity for love who takes pity on human love, because it is so paltry, so ignorant he who has such sentiments, he who has such knowledge about love seeks for death but why should one deal with such painful matters provided, of course, that one is not obliged to do so. the intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who has suffered deeply it almost determines the order of rank how deeply men can suffer the chilling certainty, with which he is thoroughly imbued and coloured, that by virtue of his suffering he knows more than the shrewdest and wisest can ever know, that he has been familiar with, and at home in, many distant, dreadful worlds of which you know nothing this silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer, this pride of the elect of knowledge, of the initiated, of the almost sacrificed, finds all forms of disguise necessary to protect itself from contact with officious and sympathizing hands, and in general from all that is not its equal in suffering. profound suffering makes noble: it separates. one of the most refined forms of disguise is epicurism, along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste, which takes suffering lightly, and puts itself on the defensive against all that is sorrowful and profound. they are gay men who make use of gaiety, because they are misunderstood on account of it they wish to be misunderstood. there are scientific minds who make use of science, because it gives a gay appearance, and because scientificness leads to the conclusion that a person is superficial they wish to mislead to a false conclusion. there are free insolent minds which would fain conceal and deny that they are broken, proud, incurable hearts (the cynicism of hamlet the case of galiani); and occasionally folly itself is the mask of an unfortunate over-assured knowledge. from which it follows that it is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence for the mask, and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place. that which separates two men most profoundly is a different sense and grade of purity. what does it matter about all their honesty and reciprocal usefulness, what does it matter about all their mutual good-will: the fact still remains they cannot smell each other the highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the most extraordinary and dangerous isolation, as a saint: for it is just holiness the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question. any kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath, any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out of night into the morning, and out of gloom, out of affliction into clearness, brightness, depth, and refinement: just as much as such a tendency distinguishes it is a noble tendency it also separates. the pity of the saint is pity for the filth of the human, all-too-human. and there are grades and heights where pity itself is regarded by him as impurity, as filth. signs of nobility: never to think of lowering our duties to the rank of duties for everybody; to be unwilling to renounce or to share our responsibilities; to count our prerogatives, and the exercise of them, among our duties. a man who strives after great things, looks upon every one whom he encounters on his way either as a means of advance, or a delay and hindrance or as a temporary resting-place. his peculiar lofty bounty to his fellow-men is only possible when he attains his elevation and dominates. impatience, and the consciousness of being always condemned to comedy up to that time for even strife is a comedy, and conceals the end, as every means does spoil all intercourse for him; this kind of man is acquainted with solitude, and what is most poisonous in it. the problem of those who wait. happy chances are necessary, and many incalculable elements, in order that a higher man in whom the solution of a problem is dormant, may yet take action, or break forth, as one might say at the right moment. on an average it does not happen; and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting who hardly know to what extent they are waiting, and still less that they wait in vain. occasionally, too, the waking call comes too late the chance which gives permission to take action when their best youth, and strength for action have been used up in sitting still; and how many a one, just as he sprang up, has found with horror that his limbs are benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy it is too late, he has said to himself and has become self-distrustful and henceforth for ever useless. in the domain of genius, may not the raphael without hands (taking the expression in its widest sense) perhaps not be the exception, but the rule perhaps genius is by no means so rare: but rather the five hundred hands which it requires in order to tyrannize over the [greek inserted here], the right time in order to take chance by the forelock he who does not wish to see the height of a man, looks all the more sharply at what is low in him, and in the foreground and thereby betrays himself. in all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is better off than the nobler soul: the dangers of the latter must be greater, the probability that it will come to grief and perish is in fact immense, considering the multiplicity of the conditions of its existence. in a lizard a finger grows again which has been lost; not so in man. it is too bad always the old story when a man has finished building his house, he finds that he has learnt unawares something which he ought absolutely to have known before he began to build. the eternal, fatal too late the melancholia of everything completed wanderer, who art thou i see thee follow thy path without scorn, without love, with unfathomable eyes, wet and sad as a plummet which has returned to the light insatiated out of every depth what did it seek down there with a bosom that never sighs, with lips that conceal their loathing, with a hand which only slowly grasps: who art thou what hast thou done rest thee here: this place has hospitality for every one refresh thyself and whoever thou art, what is it that now pleases thee what will serve to refresh thee only name it, whatever i have i offer thee to refresh me to refresh me oh, thou prying one, what sayest thou but give me, i pray thee - what what speak out another mask a second mask men of profound sadness betray themselves when they are happy: they have a mode of seizing upon happiness as though they would choke and strangle it, out of jealousy ah, they know only too well that it will flee from them bad bad what does he not go back yes but you misunderstand him when you complain about it. he goes back like every one who is about to make a great spring. will people believe it of me but i insist that they believe it of me: i have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about myself, only in very rare cases, only compulsorily, always without delight in 'the subject,' ready to digress from 'myself,' and always without faith in the result, owing to an unconquerable distrust of the possibility of self-knowledge, which has led me so far as to feel a contradictio in adjecto even in the idea of 'direct knowledge' which theorists allow themselves: this matter of fact is almost the most certain thing i know about myself. there must be a sort of repugnance in me to believe anything definite about myself. is there perhaps some enigma therein probably; but fortunately nothing for my own teeth. perhaps it betrays the species to which i belong but not to myself, as is sufficiently agreeable to me. but what has happened to you i do not know, he said, hesitatingly; perhaps the harpies have flown over my table. it sometimes happens nowadays that a gentle, sober, retiring man becomes suddenly mad, breaks the plates, upsets the table, shrieks, raves, and shocks everybody and finally withdraws, ashamed, and raging at himself whither for what purpose to famish apart to suffocate with his memories to him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul, and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared, the danger will always be great nowadays, however, it is extraordinarily so. thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age, with which he does not like to eat out of the same dish, he may readily perish of hunger and thirst or, should he nevertheless finally fall to, of sudden nausea. we have probably all sat at tables to which we did not belong; and precisely the most spiritual of us, who are most difficult to nourish, know the dangerous dyspepsia which originates from a sudden insight and disillusionment about our food and our messmates the after-dinner nausea. if one wishes to praise at all, it is a delicate and at the same time a noble self-control, to praise only where one does not agree otherwise in fact one would praise oneself, which is contrary to good taste: a self-control, to be sure, which offers excellent opportunity and provocation to constant misunderstanding. to be able to allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality, one must not live among intellectual imbeciles, but rather among men whose misunderstandings and mistakes amuse by their refinement or one will have to pay dearly for it he praises me, therefore he acknowledges me to be right this asinine method of inference spoils half of the life of us recluses, for it brings the asses into our neighbourhood and friendship. to live in a vast and proud tranquility; always beyond... to have, or not to have, one's emotions, one's for and against, according to choice; to lower oneself to them for hours; to seat oneself on them as upon horses, and often as upon asses: for one must know how to make use of their stupidity as well as of their fire. to conserve one's three hundred foregrounds; also one's black spectacles: for there are circumstances when nobody must look into our eyes, still less into our motives. and to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice, politeness. and to remain master of one's four virtues, courage, insight, sympathy, and solitude. for solitude is a virtue with us, as a sublime bent and bias to purity, which divines that in the contact of man and man in society it must be unavoidably impure. all society makes one somehow, somewhere, or sometime commonplace. the greatest events and thoughts the greatest thoughts, however, are the greatest events are longest in being comprehended: the generations which are contemporary with them do not experience such events they live past them. something happens there as in the realm of stars. the light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man; and before it has arrived man denies that there are stars there. how many centuries does a mind require to be understood that is also a standard, one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewith, such as is necessary for mind and for star. here is the prospect free, the mind exalted. [footnote: goethe's faust, part ii, act v. the words of dr. marianus.] but there is a reverse kind of man, who is also upon a height, and has also a free prospect but looks downwards. what is noble what does the word noble still mean for us nowadays how does the noble man betray himself, how is he recognized under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism, by which everything is rendered opaque and leaden it is not his actions which establish his claim actions are always ambiguous, always inscrutable; neither is it his works. one finds nowadays among artists and scholars plenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing for nobleness impels them; but this very need of nobleness is radically different from the needs of the noble soul itself, and is in fact the eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof. it is not the works, but the belief which is here decisive and determines the order of rank to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper meaning it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and perhaps, also, is not to be lost. the noble soul has reverence for itself. there are men who are unavoidably intellectual, let them turn and twist themselves as they will, and hold their hands before their treacherous eyes as though the hand were not a betrayer; it always comes out at last that they have something which they hide namely, intellect. one of the subtlest means of deceiving, at least as long as possible, and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider than one really is which in everyday life is often as desirable as an umbrella, is called enthusiasm, including what belongs to it, for instance, virtue. for as galiani said, who was obliged to know it: vertu est enthousiasme. in the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echo of the wilderness, something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance of solitude; in his strongest words, even in his cry itself, there sounds a new and more dangerous kind of silence, of concealment. he who has sat day and night, from year's end to year's end, alone with his soul in familiar discord and discourse, he who has become a cave-bear, or a treasure-seeker, or a treasure-guardian and dragon in his cave it may be a labyrinth, but can also be a gold-mine his ideas themselves eventually acquire a twilight-colour of their own, and an odour, as much of the depth as of the mould, something uncommunicative and repulsive, which blows chilly upon every passer-by. the recluse does not believe that a philosopher supposing that a philosopher has always in the first place been a recluse ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions in books: are not books written precisely to hide what is in us indeed, he will doubt whether a philosopher can have ultimate and actual opinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not, and must necessarily be, a still deeper cave: an ampler, stranger, richer world beyond the surface, an abyss behind every bottom, beneath every foundation. every philosophy is a foreground philosophy this is a recluse's verdict: there is something arbitrary in the fact that the philosopher came to a stand here, took a retrospect, and looked around; that he here laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper there is also something suspicious in it. every philosophy also conceals a philosophy; every opinion is also a lurking-place, every word is also a mask. every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood. the latter perhaps wounds his vanity; but the former wounds his heart, his sympathy, which always says: ah, why would you also have as hard a time of it as i have man, a complex, mendacious, artful, and inscrutable animal, uncanny to the other animals by his artifice and sagacity, rather than by his strength, has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his soul as something simple; and the whole of morality is a long, audacious falsification, by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of the soul becomes possible. from this point of view there is perhaps much more in the conception of art than is generally believed. a philosopher: that is a man who constantly experiences, sees, hears, suspects, hopes, and dreams extraordinary things; who is struck by his own thoughts as if they came from the outside, from above and below, as a species of events and lightning-flashes peculiar to him; who is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings; a portentous man, around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and something uncanny going on. a philosopher: alas, a being who often runs away from himself, is often afraid of himself but whose curiosity always makes him come to himself again. a man who says: i like that, i take it for my own, and mean to guard and protect it from every one; a man who can conduct a case, carry out a resolution, remain true to an opinion, keep hold of a woman, punish and overthrow insolence; a man who has his indignation and his sword, and to whom the weak, the suffering, the oppressed, and even the animals willingly submit and naturally belong; in short, a man who is a master by nature when such a man has sympathy, well that sympathy has value but of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer or of those even who preach sympathy there is nowadays, throughout almost the whole of europe, a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain, and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining, an effeminizing, which, with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense, seeks to deck itself out as something superior there is a regular cult of suffering. the unmanliness of that which is called sympathy by such groups of visionaries, is always, i believe, the first thing that strikes the eye. one must resolutely and radically taboo this latest form of bad taste; and finally i wish people to put the good amulet, gai saber (gay science, in ordinary language), on heart and neck, as a protection against it. the olympian vice. despite the philosopher who, as a genuine englishman, tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking minds laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature, which every thinking mind will strive to overcome (hobbes), i would even allow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of their laughing up to those who are capable of golden laughter. and supposing that gods also philosophize, which i am strongly inclined to believe, owing to many reasons i have no doubt that they also know how to laugh thereby in an overman-like and new fashion and at the expense of all serious things gods are fond of ridicule: it seems that they cannot refrain from laughter even in holy matters. the genius of the heart, as that great mysterious one possesses it, the tempter-god and born rat-catcher of consciences, whose voice can descend into the nether-world of every soul, who neither speaks a word nor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch of allurement, to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to appear, not as he is, but in a guise which acts as an additional constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him, to follow him more cordially and thoroughly; the genius of the heart, which imposes silence and attention on everything loud and self-conceited, which smoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing to lie placid as a mirror, that the deep heavens may be reflected in them; the genius of the heart, which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate, and to grasp more delicately; which scents the hidden and forgotten treasure, the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark ice, and is a divining-rod for every grain of gold, long buried and imprisoned in mud and sand; the genius of the heart, from contact with which every one goes away richer; not favoured or surprised, not as though gratified and oppressed by the good things of others; but richer in himself, newer than before, broken up, blown upon, and sounded by a thawing wind; more uncertain, perhaps, more delicate, more fragile, more bruised, but full of hopes which as yet lack names, full of a new will and current, full of a new ill-will and counter-current... but what am i doing, my friends of whom am i talking to you have i forgotten myself so far that i have not even told you his name unless it be that you have already divined of your own accord who this questionable god and spirit is, that wishes to be praised in such a manner for, as it happens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his legs, and in foreign lands, i have also encountered on my path many strange and dangerous spirits; above all, however, and again and again, the one of whom i have just spoken: in fact, no less a personage than the god dionysus, the great equivocator and tempter, to whom, as you know, i once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first-fruits the last, as it seems to me, who has offered a sacrifice to him, for i have found no one who could understand what i was then doing. in the meantime, however, i have learned much, far too much, about the philosophy of this god, and, as i said, from mouth to mouth i, the last disciple and initiate of the god dionysus: and perhaps i might at last begin to give you, my friends, as far as i am allowed, a little taste of this philosophy in a hushed voice, as is but seemly: for it has to do with much that is secret, new, strange, wonderful, and uncanny. the very fact that dionysus is a philosopher, and that therefore gods also philosophize, seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers; among you, my friends, there is less to be said against it, except that it comes too late and not at the right time; for, as it has been disclosed to me, you are loth nowadays to believe in god and gods. it may happen, too, that in the frankness of my story i must go further than is agreeable to the strict usages of your ears certainly the god in question went further, very much further, in such dialogues, and was always many paces ahead of me... indeed, if it were allowed, i should have to give him, according to human usage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, i should have to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless honesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. but such a god does not know what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. keep that, he would say, for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require it i have no reason to cover my nakedness one suspects that this kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame he once said: under certain circumstances i love mankind and referred thereby to ariadne, who was present; in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave, inventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his way even through all labyrinths. i like man, and often think how i can still further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more profound. stronger, more evil, and more profound i asked in horror. yes, he said again, stronger, more evil, and more profound; also more beautiful and thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile, as though he had just paid some charming compliment. one here sees at once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks; and in general there are good grounds for supposing that in some things the gods could all of them come to us men for instruction. we men are more human. alas what are you, after all, my written and painted thoughts not long ago you were so variegated, young and malicious, so full of thorns and secret spices, that you made me sneeze and laugh and now you have already doffed your novelty, and some of you, i fear, are ready to become truths, so immortal do they look, so pathetically honest, so tedious and was it ever otherwise what then do we write and paint, we mandarins with chinese brush, we immortalisers of things which lend themselves to writing, what are we alone capable of painting alas, only that which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour alas, only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments alas, only birds strayed and fatigued by flight, which now let themselves be captured with the hand with our hand we immortalize what cannot live and fly much longer, things only which are exhausted and mellow and it is only for your afternoon, you, my written and painted thoughts, for which alone i have colours, many colours, perhaps, many variegated softenings, and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds; but nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning, you sudden sparks and marvels of my solitude, you, my old, beloved evil thoughts \""

       "\"alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, and where is the use of a book, thought alice, without pictures or conversations so she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain was worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. there was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself dear, dear i shall be too late (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all quite natural); but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, looked at it, and then hurried on, alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and, full of curiosity, she hurried across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. in a moment down went alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly, that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself, before she found herself falling down what seemed a deep well. either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what would happen next. first, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then, she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there were maps and pictures hung on pegs. she took a jar down off one of the shelves as she passed: it was labelled orange marmalade, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. well thought alice to herself, after such a fall as this, i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave they'll all think me at home why, i wouldn't say anything about it, even if i fell off the top of the house (which was most likely true.) down, down, down. would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles i've fallen by this time she said aloud, i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, i think (for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity of showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to hear her, still it was good practice to say it over,) yes that's the right distance, but then what longitude or latitude-line shall i be in (alice had no idea what longitude was, or latitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.) presently she began again: i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny it'll be to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. please, ma'am, is this new zealand or australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke (fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air do you think you could manage it ) and what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking no, it'll never do to ask: perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere. down, down, down: there was nothing else to do, so alice soon began talking again. dinah will miss me very much tonight, i should think (dinah was the cat.) i hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time oh, dear dinah, i wish i had you here there are no mice in the air, i'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know, my dear. but do cats eat bats, i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy, and kept on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes, do bats eat cats for, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. she felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah, and was saying to her very earnestly, now, dinah, my dear, tell me the truth. did you ever eat a bat when suddenly, bump bump down she came upon a heap of sticks and shavings, and the fall was over. alice was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. there was not a moment to be lost: away went alice like the wind, and just heard it say, as it turned a corner, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting she turned the corner after it, and instantly found herself in a long, low hall, lit up by a row of lamps which hung from the roof. there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when alice had been all round it, and tried them all, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again: suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing lying upon it, but a tiny golden key, and alice's first idea was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall, but alas either the locks were too large, or the key too small, but at any rate it would open none of them. however, on the second time round, she came to a low curtain, behind which was a door about eighteen inches high: she tried the little key in the keyhole, and it fitted alice opened the door, and looked down a small passage, not larger than a rat-hole, into the loveliest garden you ever saw. how she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway, and even if my head would go through, thought poor alice, it would be very little use without my shoulders. oh, how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could, if i only knew how to begin. for, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that alice began to think very few things indeed were really impossible. there was nothing else to do, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting up people like telescopes: this time there was a little bottle on it which certainly was not there before said alice and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters. it was all very well to say drink me, but i'll look first, said the wise little alice, and see whether the bottle's marked poison or not, for alice had read several nice little stories about children that got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had given them, such as, that, if you get into the fire, it will burn you, and that, if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it generally bleeds, and she had never forgotten that, if you drink a bottle marked poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later. however, this bottle was not marked poison, so alice tasted it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off. what a curious feeling said alice, i must be shutting up like a telescope. it was so indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up as it occurred to her that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. first, however, she waited for a few minutes to see whether she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this, for it might end, you know, said alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle, and what should i be like then, i wonder and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember having ever seen one. however, nothing more happened so she decided on going into the garden at once, but, alas for poor alice when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for the key, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery, and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. come there's no use in crying said alice to herself rather sharply, i advise you to leave off this minute (she generally gave herself very good advice, and sometimes scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes, and once she remembered boxing her own ears for having been unkind to herself in a game of croquet she was playing with herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people,) but it's no use now, thought poor alice, to pretend to be two people why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person soon her eyes fell on a little ebony box lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which was lying a card with the words eat me beautifully printed on it in large letters. i'll eat, said alice, and if it makes me larger, i can reach the key, and if it makes me smaller, i can creep under the door, so either way i'll get into the garden, and i don't care which happens she ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself which way which way and laid her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure this is what generally happens when one eats cake, but alice had got into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the way things to happen, and it seemed quite dull and stupid for things to go on in the common way. so she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. curiouser and curiouser cried alice, (she was so surprised that she quite forgot how to speak good english,) now i'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was goodbye, feet (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they were getting so far off,) oh, my poor little feet, i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears i'm sure i can't i shall be a great deal too far off to bother myself about you: you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them, thought alice, or perhaps they won't walk the way i want to go let me see: i'll give them a new pair of boots every christmas. and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it they must go by the carrier, she thought, and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet and how odd the directions will look alice's right foot, esq. the carpet, with alice's love oh dear what nonsense i am talking just at this moment, her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key, and hurried off to the garden door. poor alice it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye, but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and cried again. you ought to be ashamed of yourself, said alice, a great girl like you, (she might well say this,) to cry in this way stop this instant, i tell you but she cried on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool, about four inches deep, all round her, and reaching half way across the hall. after a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and dried her eyes to see what was coming. it was the white rabbit coming back again, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand, and a nosegay in the other. alice was ready to ask help of any one, she felt so desperate, and as the rabbit passed her, she said, in a low, timid voice, if you please, sir the rabbit started violently, looked up once into the roof of the hall, from which the voice seemed to come, and then dropped the nosegay and the white kid gloves, and skurried away into the darkness, as hard as it could go. alice took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so delicious that she kept smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself dear, dear how queer everything is today and yesterday everything happened just as usual: i wonder if i was changed in the night let me think: was i the same when i got up this morning i think i remember feeling rather different. but if i'm not the same, who in the world am i ah, that's the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them. i'm sure i'm not gertrude, she said, for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all and i'm sure i ca'n't be florence, for i know all sorts of things, and she, oh she knows such a very little besides, she's she, and i'm i, and oh dear how puzzling it all is i'll try if i know all the things i used to know. let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is fourteen oh dear i shall never get to twenty at this rate but the multiplication table don't signify let's try geography. london is the capital of france, and rome is the capital of yorkshire, and paris oh dear dear that's all wrong, i'm certain i must have been changed for florence i'll try and say how doth the little, and she crossed her hands on her lap, and began, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not sound the same as they used to do: how doth the little crocodile improve its shining tail, and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale how cheerfully it seems to grin how neatly spreads its claws and welcomes little fishes in with gently-smiling jaws i'm sure those are not the right words, said poor alice, and her eyes filled with tears as she thought i must be florence after all, and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh ever so many lessons to learn no i've made up my mind about it: if i'm florence, i'll stay down here it'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying 'come up, dear ' i shall only look up and say 'who am i then answer me that first, and then, if i like being that person, i'll come up: if not, i'll stay down here till i'm somebody else but, oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst of tears, i do wish they would put their heads down i am so tired of being all alone here as she said this, she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to find she had put on one of the rabbit's little gloves while she was talking. how can i have done that thought she, i must be growing small again. she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: soon she found out that the reason of it was the nosegay she held in her hand: she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether, and found that she was now only three inches high. now for the garden cried alice, as she hurried back to the little door, but the little door was locked again, and the little gold key was lying on the glass table as before, and things are worse than ever thought the poor little girl, for i never was as small as this before, never and i declare it's too bad, it is at this moment her foot slipped, and splash she was up to her chin in salt water. her first idea was that she had fallen into the sea: then she remembered that she was under ground, and she soon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high. i wish i hadn't cried so much said alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out, i shall be punished for it now, i suppose, by being drowned in my own tears well that'll be a queer thing, to be sure however, every thing is queer today. very soon she saw something splashing about in the pool near her: at first she thought it must be a walrus or a hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was herself, and soon made out that it was only a mouse, that had slipped in like herself. would it be any use, now, thought alice, to speak to this mouse the rabbit is something quite out-of-the-way, no doubt, and so have i been, ever since i came down here, but that is no reason why the mouse should not be able to talk. i think i may as well try. so she began: oh mouse, do you know how to get out of this pool i am very tired of swimming about here, oh mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. perhaps it doesn't understand english, thought alice; i daresay it's a french mouse, come over with william the conqueror (for, with all her knowledge of history, alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened,) so she began again: ou est ma chatte which was the first sentence out of her french lesson-book. the mouse gave a sudden jump in the pool, and seemed to quiver with fright: oh, i beg your pardon cried alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings, i quite forgot you didn't like cats not like cats cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice, would you like cats if you were me well, perhaps not, said alice in a soothing tone, don't be angry about it. and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah: i think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. she is such a dear quiet thing, said alice, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face: and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse, and she's such a capital one for catching mice oh i beg your pardon cried poor alice again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain that it was really offended, have i offended you offended indeed cried the mouse, who seemed to be positively trembling with rage, our family always hated cats nasty, low, vulgar things don't talk to me about them any more i won't indeed said alice, in a great hurry to change the conversation, are you are you fond of dogs the mouse did not answer, so alice went on eagerly: there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh such long curly brown hair and it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things i ca'n't remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer, and he says it kills all the rats and oh dear said alice sadly, i'm afraid i've offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. so she called softly after it: mouse dear do come back again, and we won't talk about cats and dogs any more, if you don't like them when the mouse heard this, it turned and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale, (with passion, alice thought,) and it said in a trembling low voice let's get to the shore, and then i'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs. it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of birds and animals that had fallen into it. there was a duck and a dodo, a lory and an eaglet, and several other curious creatures. alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. they were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable. the first question of course was, how to get dry: they had a consultation about this, and alice hardly felt at all surprised at finding herself talking familiarly with the birds, as if she had known them all her life. indeed, she had quite a long argument with the lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say i am older than you, and must know best, and this alice would not admit without knowing how old the lory was, and as the lory positively refused to tell its age, there was nothing more to be said. at last the mouse, who seemed to have some authority among them, called out sit down, all of you, and attend to me i'll soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once, shivering, in a large ring, alice in the middle, with her eyes anxiously fixed on the mouse, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. ahem said the mouse, with a self-important air, are you all ready this is the driest thing i know. silence all round, if you please william the conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the english, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. edwin and morcar, the earls of mercia and northumbria ugh said the lory with a shiver. i beg your pardon said the mouse, frowning, but very politely, did you speak not i said the lory hastily. i thought you did, said the mouse, i proceed. edwin and morcar, the earls of mercia and northumbria, declared for him; and even stigand, the patriotic archbishop of canterbury, found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown. william's conduct was at first moderate how are you getting on now, dear said the mouse, turning to alice as it spoke. as wet as ever, said poor alice, it doesn't seem to dry me at all. in that case, said the dodo solemnly, rising to his feet, i move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies speak english said the duck, i don't know the meaning of half those long words, and what's more, i don't believe you do either and the duck quacked a comfortable laugh to itself. some of the other birds tittered audibly. i only meant to say, said the dodo in a rather offended tone, that i know of a house near here, where we could get the young lady and the rest of the party dried, and then we could listen comfortably to the story which i think you were good enough to promise to tell us, bowing gravely to the mouse. the mouse made no objection to this, and the whole party moved along the river bank, (for the pool had by this time began to flow out of the hall, and the edge of it was fringed with rushes and forget-me-nots,) in a slow procession, the dodo leading the way. after a time the dodo became impatient, and, leaving the duck to bring up the rest of the party, moved on at a quicker pace with alice, the lory, and the eaglet, and soon brought them to a little cottage, and there they sat snugly by the fire, wrapped up in blankets, until the rest of the party had arrived, and they were all dry again. then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank, and begged the mouse to begin his story. mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse, turning to alice, and sighing. it is a long tail, certainly, said alice, looking down with wonder at the mouse's tail, which was coiled nearly all round the party, but why do you call it sad and she went on puzzling about this as the mouse went on speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this: you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely, what are you thinking of i beg your pardon, said alice very humbly, you had got to the fifth bend, i think i had not cried the mouse, sharply and very angrily. a knot said alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her, oh, do let me help to undo it i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse, getting up and walking away from the party, you insult me by talking such nonsense i didn't mean it pleaded poor alice, but you're so easily offended, you know. the mouse only growled in reply. please come back and finish your story alice called after it, and the others all joined in chorus yes, please do but the mouse only shook its ears, and walked quickly away, and was soon out of sight. what a pity it wouldn't stay sighed the lory, and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to its daughter ah, my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongue, ma said the young crab, a little snappishly, you're enough to try the patience of an oyster i wish i had our dinah here, i know i do said alice aloud, addressing no one in particular, she'd soon fetch it back and who is dinah, if i might venture to ask the question said the lory. alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet, dinah's our cat. and she's such a capital one for catching mice, you can't think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it this answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party: some of the birds hurried off at once; one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking i really must be getting home: the night air does not suit my throat, and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away from her, my dears, she's no fit company for you on various pretexts, they all moved off, and alice was soon left alone. she sat for some while sorrowful and silent, but she was not long before she recovered her spirits, and began talking to herself again as usual: i do wish some of them had stayed a little longer and i was getting to be such friends with them really the lory and i were almost like sisters and so was that dear little eaglet and then the duck and the dodo how nicely the duck sang to us as we came along through the water: and if the dodo hadn't known the way to that nice little cottage, i don't know when we should have got dry again and there is no knowing how long she might have prattled on in this way, if she had not suddenly caught the sound of pattering feet. it was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about it as it went, as if it had lost something, and she heard it muttering to itself the marchioness the marchioness oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers she'll have me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them, i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the nosegay and the pair of white kid gloves, and she began hunting for them, but they were now nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and her walk along the river-bank with its fringe of rushes and forget-me-nots, and the glass table and the little door had vanished. soon the rabbit noticed alice, as she stood looking curiously about her, and at once said in a quick angry tone, why, mary ann what are you doing out here go home this moment, and look on my dressing-table for my gloves and nosegay, and fetch them here, as quick as you can run, do you hear and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once, without saying a word, in the direction which the rabbit had pointed out. she soon found herself in front of a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w. rabbit, esq. she went in, and hurried upstairs, for fear she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the gloves: she knew that one pair had been lost in the hall, but of course, thought alice, it has plenty more of them in its house. how queer it seems to be going messages for a rabbit i suppose dinah'll be sending me messages next and she began fancying the sort of things that would happen: miss alice come here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute, nurse but i've got to watch this mousehole till dinah comes back, and see that the mouse doesn't get out only i don't think, alice went on, that they'd let dinah stop in the house, if it began ordering people about like that by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room, with a table in the window on which was a looking-glass and, (as alice had hoped,) two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up a pair of gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass: there was no label on it this time with the words drink me, but nonetheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips: i know something interesting is sure to happen, she said to herself, whenever i eat or drink anything, so i'll see what this bottle does. i do hope it'll make me grow larger, for i'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing it did so indeed, and much sooner than she expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and she stooped to save her neck from being broken, and hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself that's quite enough i hope i sha'n't grow any more i wish i hadn't drunk so much alas it was too late: she went on growing and growing, and very soon had to kneel down: in another minute there was not room even for this, and she tried the effect of lying down, with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. still she went on growing, and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself now i can do no more what will become of me luckily for alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger; still it was very uncomfortable, and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. it was much pleasanter at home, thought poor alice, when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits i almost wish i hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole, and yet, and yet it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life. i do wonder what can have happened to me when i used to read fairy-tales, i fancied that sort of thing never happened, and now here i am in the middle of one there out to be a book written about me, that there ought and when i grow up i'll write one but i'm grown up now said she in a sorrowful tone, at least there's no room to grow up any more here. but then, thought alice, shall i never get any older than i am now that'll be a comfort, one way never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons to learn oh, i shouldn't like that oh, you foolish alice she said again, how can you learn lessons in here why, there's hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books and so she went on, taking first one side, and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether, but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, which made her stop to listen. mary ann mary ann said the voice, fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs: alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it. presently the rabbit came to the door, and tried to open it, but as it opened inwards, and alice's elbow was against it, the attempt proved a failure. alice heard it say to itself then i'll go round and get in at the window. that you wo'n't thought alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit, just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. she did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of breaking glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. next came an angry voice the rabbit's pat, pat where are you and then a voice she had never heard before, shure then i'm here digging for apples, anyway, yer honour digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily, here, come and help me out of this sound of more breaking glass. now, tell me, pat, what is that coming out of the window shure it's an arm, yer honour (he pronounced it arrum.) an arm, you goose who ever saw an arm that size why, it fills the whole window, don't you see shure, it does, yer honour, but it's an arm for all that. well, it's no business there: go and take it away there was a long silence after this, and alice could only hear whispers now and then, such as shure i don't like it, yer honour, at all at all do as i tell you, you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. this time there were two little shrieks, and more breaking glass what a number of cucumber-frames there must be thought alice, i wonder what they'll do next as for pulling me out of the window, i only wish they could i'm sure i don't want to stop in here any longer she waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words where's the other ladder why, i hadn't to bring but one, bill's got the other here, put 'em up at this corner no, tie 'em together first they don't reach high enough yet oh, they'll do well enough, don't be particular here, bill catch hold of this rope will the roof bear mind that loose slate oh, it's coming down heads below (a loud crash) now, who did that it was bill, i fancy who's to go down the chimney nay, i sha'n't you do it that i won't then bill's got to go down here, bill the master says you've to go down the chimney oh, so bill's got to come down the chimney, has he said alice to herself, why, they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldn't be in bill's place for a good deal: the fireplace is a pretty tight one, but i think i can kick a little she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess what sort it was) scratching and scrambling in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself this is bill, she gave one sharp kick, and waited again to see what would happen next. the first thing was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbit's voice alone catch him, you by the hedge then silence, and then another confusion of voices, how was it, old fellow what happened to you tell us all about it. last came a little feeble squeaking voice, (that's bill thought alice,) which said well, i hardly know i'm all of a fluster myself something comes at me like a jack-in-the-box, and the next minute up i goes like a rocket and so you did, old fellow said the other voices. we must burn the house down said the voice of the rabbit, and alice called out as loud as she could if you do, i'll set dinah at you this caused silence again, and while alice was thinking but how can i get dinah here she found to her great delight that she was getting smaller: very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable position in which she had been lying, and in two or three minutes more she was once more three inches high. she ran out of the house as quick as she could, and found quite a crowd of little animals waiting outside guinea-pigs, white mice, squirrels, and bill a little green lizard, that was being supported in the arms of one of the guinea-pigs, while another was giving it something out of a bottle. they all made a rush at her the moment she appeared, but alice ran her hardest, and soon found herself in a thick wood. the first thing i've got to do, said alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, is to grow to my right size, and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. i think that will be the best plan. it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged: the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it, and while she was peering anxiously among the trees round her, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to reach her: poor thing said alice in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it, but she was terribly alarmed all the while at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would probably devour her in spite of all her coaxing. hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy: whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, and with a yelp of delight rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over, and, the moment she appeared at the other side, the puppy made another dart at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold: then alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again: then the puppy begin a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut. this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape. she set off at once, and ran till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance, and till she was quite tired and out of breath. and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with her hat. i should have liked teaching it tricks, if if i'd only been the right size to do it oh i'd nearly forgotten that i've got to grow up again let me see; how is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other, but the great question is what the great question certainly was, what alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat under the circumstances. there was a large mushroom near her, about the same height as herself, and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her to look and see what was on the top of it. she stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, which was sitting with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the least notice of her or of anything else. for some time they looked at each other in silence: at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and languidly addressed her. who are you said the caterpillar. this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation: alice replied rather shyly, i i hardly know, sir, just at present at least i know who i was when i got up this morning, but i think i must have been changed several times since that. what do you mean by that said the caterpillar, explain yourself i ca'n't explain myself, i'm afraid, sir, said alice, because i'm not myself, you see. i don't see, said the caterpillar. i'm afraid i can't put it more clearly, alice replied very politely, for i ca'n't understand it myself, and really to be so many different sizes in one day is very confusing. it isn't, said the caterpillar. well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet, said alice, but when you have to turn into a chrysalis, you know, and then after that into a butterfly, i should think it'll feel a little queer, don't you think so not a bit, said the caterpillar. all i know is, said alice, it would feel queer to me. you said the caterpillar contemptuously, who are you which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation: alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are, first. why said the caterpillar. here was another puzzling question: and as alice had no reason ready, and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very bad temper, she turned round and walked away. come back the caterpillar called after her, i've something important to say this sounded promising: alice turned and came back again. keep your temper, said the caterpillar. is that all said alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. no, said the caterpillar. alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all the caterpillar might tell her something worth hearing. for some minutes it puffed away at its hookah without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said so you think you're changed, do you yes, sir, said alice, i ca'n't remember the things i used to know i've tried to say how doth the little busy bee and it came all different try and repeat you are old, father william, said the caterpillar. alice folded her hands, and began: you are old, father william, the young man said, and your hair is exceedingly white: and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think, at your age, it is right in my youth, father william replied to his son, i feared it might injure the brain but now that i'm perfectly sure i have none, why, i do it again and again. you are old, said the youth, as i mentioned before, and have grown most uncommonly fat: yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that in my youth, said the sage, as he shook his gray locks, i kept all my limbs very supple, by the use of this ointment, five shillings the box allow me to sell you a couple. you are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet: yet you eat all the goose, with the bones and the beak pray, how did you manage to do it in my youth, said the old man, i took to the law, and argued each case with my wife, and the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, has lasted the rest of my life. you are old, said the youth; one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever: yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever i have answered three questions, and that is enough, said his father, don't give yourself airs do you think i can listen all day to such stuff be off, or i'll kick you down stairs that is not said right, said the caterpillar. not quite right, i'm afraid, said alice timidly, some of the words have got altered. it is wrong from beginning to end, said the caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes: the caterpillar was the first to speak. what size do you want to be it asked. oh, i'm not particular as to size, alice hastily replied, only one doesn't like changing so often, you know. are you content now said the caterpillar. well, i should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind, said alice, three inches is such a wretched height to be. it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar loudly and angrily, rearing itself straight up as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). but i'm not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone, and she thought to herself i wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended you'll get used to it in time, said the caterpillar, and it put the hookah into its mouth, and began smoking again. this time alice waited quietly until it chose to speak again: in a few minutes the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and got down off the mushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely remarking as it went; the top will make you grow taller, and the stalk will make you grow shorter. the top of what the stalk of what thought alice. of the mushroom, said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud, and in another moment was out of sight. alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, and then picked it and carefully broke it in two, taking the stalk in one hand, and the top in the other. which does the stalk do she said, and nibbled a little bit of it to try; the next moment she felt a violent blow on her chin: it had struck her foot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but as she did not shrink any further, and had not dropped the top of the mushroom, she did not give up hope yet. there was hardly room to open her mouth, with her chin pressing against her foot, but she did it at last, and managed to bite off a little bit of the top of the mushroom. come my head's free at last said alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be seen: she looked down upon an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her. what can all that green stuff be said alice, and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i ca'n't see you she was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little rustling among the leaves. then she tried to bring her head down to her hands, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in every direction, like a serpent. she had just succeeded in bending it down in a beautiful zig-zag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had been wandering in, when a sharp hiss made her draw back: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was violently beating her with its wings. serpent screamed the pigeon. i'm not a serpent said alice indignantly, let me alone i've tried every way the pigeon said desperately, with a kind of sob: nothing seems to suit 'em i haven't the least idea what you mean, said alice. i've tried the roots of trees, and i've tried banks, and i've tried hedges, the pigeon went on without attending to her, but them serpents there's no pleasing 'em alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything till the pigeon had finished. as if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon, without being on the look out for serpents, day and night why, i haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks i'm very sorry you've been annoyed, said alice, beginning to see its meaning. and just as i'd taken the highest tree in the wood, said the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek, and was just thinking i was free of 'em at last, they must needs come down from the sky ugh serpent but i'm not a serpent, said alice, i'm a i'm a well what are you said the pigeon, i see you're trying to invent something. i i'm a little girl, said alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through. a likely story indeed said the pigeon, i've seen a good many of them in my time, but never one with such a neck as yours no, you're a serpent, i know that well enough i suppose you'll tell me next that you never tasted an egg i have tasted eggs, certainly, said alice, who was a very truthful child, but indeed i do'n't want any of yours. i do'n't like them raw. well, be off, then said the pigeon, and settled down into its nest again. alice crouched down among the trees, as well as she could, as her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and several times she had to stop and untwist it. soon she remembered the pieces of mushroom which she still held in her hands, and set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual size. it was so long since she had been of the right size that it felt quite strange at first, but she got quite used to it in a minute or two, and began talking to herself as usual: well there's half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are i'm never sure what i'm going to be, from one minute to another however, i've got to my right size again: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done, i wonder just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a doorway leading right into it. that's very curious she thought, but everything's curious today: i may as well go in. and in she went. once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table: now, i'll manage better this time she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. then she set to work eating the pieces of mushroom till she was about fifteen inches high: then she walked down the little passage: and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains. chapter iv a large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. this alice thought a very curious thing, and she went near to watch them, and just as she came up she heard one of them say look out, five don't go splashing paint over me like that i couldn't help it, said five in a sulky tone, seven jogged my elbow. on which seven lifted up his head and said that's right, five always lay the blame on others you'd better not talk said five, i heard the queen say only yesterday she thought of having you beheaded what for said the one who had spoken first. that's not your business, two said seven. yes, it is his business said five, and i'll tell him: it was for bringing in tulip-roots to the cook instead of potatoes. seven flung down his brush, and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye fell upon alice, and he stopped suddenly; the others looked round, and all of them took off their hats and bowed low. would you tell me, please, said alice timidly, why you are painting those roses five and seven looked at two, but said nothing: two began, in a low voice, why, miss, the fact is, this ought to have been a red rose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake, and if the queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off. so, you see, we're doing our best, before she comes, to at this moment five, who had been looking anxiously across the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. there was a sound of many footsteps, and alice looked round, eager to see the queen. first came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, flat and oblong, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were all ornamented with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. after these came the royal children: there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along, hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. next came the guests, mostly kings and queens, among whom alice recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. then followed the knave of hearts, carrying the king's crown on a cushion, and, last of all this grand procession, came the king and queen of hearts. when the procession came opposite to alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. idiot said the queen, turning up her nose, and asked alice what's your name my name is alice, so please your majesty, said alice boldly, for she thought to herself why, they're only a pack of cards i needn't be afraid of them who are these said the queen, pointing to the three gardeners lying round the rose tree, for, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. how should i know said alice, surprised at her own courage, it's no business of mine. the queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a minute, began in a voice of thunder off with her nonsense said alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the queen was silent. the king laid his hand upon her arm, and said timidly remember, my dear she is only a child the queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the knave turn them over the knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. get up said the queen, in a shrill loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the king, the queen, the royal children, and everybody else. leave off that screamed the queen, you make me giddy. and then, turning to the rose tree, she went on what have you been doing here may it please your majesty, said two very humbly, going down on one knee as he spoke, we were trying i see said the queen, who had meantime been examining the roses, off with their heads and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the three unfortunate gardeners, who ran to alice for protection. you sha'n't be beheaded said alice, and she put them into her pocket: the three soldiers marched once round her, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. are their heads off shouted the queen. their heads are gone, the soldiers shouted in reply, if it please your majesty that's right shouted the queen, can you play croquet the soldiers were silent, and looked at alice, as the question was evidently meant for her. yes shouted alice at the top of her voice. come on then roared the queen, and alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next. it's it's a very fine day said a timid little voice: she was walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. very, said alice, where's the marchioness hush, hush said the rabbit in a low voice, she'll hear you. the queen's the marchioness: didn't you know that no, i didn't, said alice, what of queen of hearts, said the rabbit in a whisper, putting its mouth close to her ear, and marchioness of mock turtles. what are they said alice, but there was no time for the answer, for they had reached the croquet-ground, and the game began instantly. alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in all her life: it was all in ridges and furrows: the croquet-balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live ostriches, and the soldiers had to double themselves up, and stand on their feet and hands, to make the arches. the chief difficulty which alice found at first was to manage her ostrich: she got its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck straightened out nicely, and was going to give a blow with its head, it would twist itself round, and look up into her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or a furrow in her way, wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. the players all played at once without waiting for turns, and quarrelled all the while at the tops of their voices, and in a very few minutes the queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about and shouting off with his head of off with her head about once in a minute. all those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of half an hour or so, there were no arches left, and all the players, except the king, the queen, and alice, were in custody, and under sentence of execution. then the queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle no, said alice, i don't even know what a mock turtle is. come on then, said the queen, and it shall tell you its history. as they walked off together, alice heard the king say in a low voice, to the company generally, you are all pardoned. come, that's a good thing thought alice, who had felt quite grieved at the number of executions which the queen had ordered. they very soon came upon a gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the sun: (if you don't know what a gryphon is, look at the picture): up, lazy thing said the queen, and take this young lady to see the mock turtle, and to hear its history. i must go back and see after some executions i ordered, and she walked off, leaving alice with the gryphon. alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it quite as safe to stay as to go after that savage queen: so she waited. the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. what fun said the gryphon, half to itself, half to alice. what is the fun said alice. why, she, said the gryphon; it's all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know: come on everybody says 'come on ' here, thought alice as she walked slowly after the gryphon; i never was ordered about so before in all my life never they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, alice could here it sighing as if its heart would break. she pitied it deeply: what is its sorrow she asked the gryphon, and the gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, it's all its fancy, that: it hasn't got no sorrow, you know: come on so they went up to the mock turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. this here young lady said the gryphon, wants for to know your history, she do. i'll tell it, said the mock turtle, in a deep hollow tone, sit down, and don't speak till i've finished. so they sat down, and no one spoke for some minutes: alice thought to herself i don't see how it can ever finish, if it doesn't begin, but she waited patiently. once, said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, i was a real turtle. these words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle. alice was very nearly getting up and saying, thank you, sir, for your interesting story, but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing. when we were little, the mock turtle went on, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, we went to school in the sea. the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise why did you call him tortoise, if he wasn't one asked alice. we called him tortoise because he taught us, said the mock turtle angrily, really you are very dull you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question, added the gryphon, and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth: at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle, get on, old fellow don't be all day and the mock turtle went on in these words: you may not have lived much under the sea (i haven't, said alice,) and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster (alice began to say i once tasted but hastily checked herself, and said no, never, instead,) so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is no, indeed, said alice, what sort of a thing is it why, said the gryphon, you form into a line along the sea shore two lines cried the mock turtle, seals, turtles, salmon, and so on advance twice each with a lobster as partner cried the gryphon. of course, the mock turtle said, advance twice, set to partners change lobsters, and retire in same order interrupted the gryphon. then, you know, continued the mock turtle, you throw the the lobsters shouted the gryphon, with a bound into the air. as far out to sea as you can swim after them screamed the gryphon. turn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle, capering wildly about. change lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice, and then that's all, said the mock turtle, suddenly dropping its voice, and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at alice. it must be a very pretty dance, said alice timidly. would you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle. very much indeed, said alice. come, let's try the first figure said the mock turtle to the gryphon, we can do it without lobsters, you know. which shall sing oh you sing said the gryphon, i've forgotten the words. so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they came too close, and waving their fore-paws to mark the time, while the mock turtle sang, slowly and sadly, these words: beneath the waters of the sea are lobsters thick as thick can be they love to dance with you and me, my own, my gentle salmon the gryphon joined in singing the chorus, which was: salmon come up salmon go down salmon come twist your tail around of all the fishes of the sea there's none so good as salmon thank you, said alice, feeling very glad that the figure was over. shall we try the second figure said the gryphon, or would you prefer a song oh, a song, please alice replied, so eagerly, that the gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, hm no accounting for tastes sing her 'mock turtle soup', will you, old fellow the mock turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this: beautiful soup, so rich and green, waiting in a hot tureen who for such dainties would not stoop soup of the evening, beautiful soup soup of the evening, beautiful soup beau ootiful soo oop beau ootiful soo oop soo oop of the e e evening, beautiful beautiful soup chorus again cried the gryphon, and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of the trial's beginning was heard in the distance. come on cried the gryphon, and, taking alice by the hand, he hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song. what trial is it panted alice as she ran, but the gryphon only answered come on and ran the faster, and more and more faintly came, borne on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words: soo oop of the e e evening, beautiful beautiful soup the king and queen were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled around them: the knave was in custody: and before the king stood the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. herald read the accusation said the king. on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows: the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day: the knave of hearts he stole those tarts, and took them quite away now for the evidence, said the king, and then the sentence. no said the queen, first the sentence, and then the evidence nonsense cried alice, so loudly that everybody jumped, the idea of having the sentence first hold your tongue said the queen. i won't said alice, you're nothing but a pack of cards who cares for you at this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream of fright, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some leaves that had fluttered down from the trees on to her face. wake up alice dear said her sister, what a nice long sleep you've had oh, i've had such a curious dream said alice, and she told her sister all her adventures under ground, as you have read them, and when she had finished, her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream, dear, certainly but now run in to your tea: it's getting late. so alice ran off, thinking while she ran (as well she might) what a wonderful dream it had been. but her sister sat there some while longer, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little alice and her adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream: she saw an ancient city, and a quiet river winding near it along the plain, and up the stream went slowly gliding a boat with a merry party of children on board she could hear their voices and laughter like music over the water and among them was another little alice, who sat listening with bright eager eyes to a tale that was being told, and she listened for the words of the tale, and lo it was the dream of her own little sister. so the boat wound slowly along, beneath the bright summer-day, with its merry crew and its music of voices and laughter, till it passed round one of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw it no more. then she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how this same little alice would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman: and how she would keep, through her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather around her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a wonderful tale, perhaps even with these very adventures of the little alice of long-ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days. happy summer days. the end. postscript. the profits, if any, of this book will be given to children's hospitals and convalescent homes for sick children; and the accounts, down to junein each year, will be published in the st. james's gazette, on the second tuesday of the following december. p.p.s. the thought, so prettily expressed by the little boy, is also to be found in longfellow's hiawatha, where he appeals to those who believe that the feeble hands and helpless, groping blindly in the darkness , touch god's right hand in that darkness , and are lifted up and strengthened . who will riddle me the how and the why so questions one of england's sweetest singers. the how has already been told, after a fashion, in the verses prefixed to alice in wonderland; and some other memories of that happy summer day are set down, for those who care to see them, in this little book the germ that was to grow into the published volume. but the why cannot, and need not, be put into words. those for whom a child's mind is a sealed book, and who see no divinity in a child's smile, would read such words in vain: while for any one that has ever loved one true child, no words are needed. for he will have known the awe that falls on one in the presence of a spirit fresh from god's hands, on whom no shadow of sin, and but the outermost fringe of the shadow of sorrow, has yet fallen: he will have felt the bitter contrast between the haunting selfishness that spoils his best deeds and the life that is but an overflowing love for i think a child's first attitude to the world is a simple love for all living things: and he will have learned that the best work a man can do is when he works for love's sake only, with no thought of name, or gain, or earthly reward. no deed of ours, i suppose, on this side the grave, is really unselfish: yet if one can put forth all one's powers in a task where nothing of reward is hoped for but a little child's whispered thanks, and the airy touch of a little child's pure lips, one seems to come somewhere near to this. there was no idea of publication in my mind when i wrote this little book : that was wholly an afterthought, pressed on me by the perhaps too partial friends who always have to bear the blame when a writer rushes into print: and i can truly say that no praise of theirs has ever given me one hundredth part of the pleasure it has been to think of the sick children in hospitals (where it has been a delight to me to send copies) forgetting, for a few bright hours, their pain and weariness perhaps thinking lovingly of the unknown writer of the tale perhaps even putting up a childish prayer (and oh, how much it needs ) for one who can but dimly hope to stand, some day, not quite out of sight of those pure young faces, before the great white throne. i am very sure, writes a lady-visitor at a home for sick children, that there will be many loving earnest prayers for you on easter morning from the children. i would like to quote further from her letters, as embodying a suggestion that may perhaps thus come to the notice of some one able and willing to carry it out. i want you to send me one of your easter greetings for a very dear child who is dying at our home. she is just fading away, and 'alice' has brightened some of the weary hours in her illness, and i know that letter would be such a delight to her especially if you would put 'minnie' at the top, and she could know you had sent it for her. she knows you, and would so value it.... she suffers so much that i long for what i know would so please her. ... thank you very much for sending me the letter, and for writing minnie's name.... i am quite sure that all these children will say a loving prayer for the 'alice-man' on easter day: and i am sure the letter will help the little ones to the real easter joy. how i do wish that you, who have won the hearts and confidence of so many children, would do for them what is so very near my heart, and yet what no one will do, viz. write a book for children about god and themselves, which is not goody, and which begins at the right end, about religion, to make them see what it really is. i get quite miserable very often over the children i come across: hardly any of them have an idea of really knowing that god loves them, or of loving and confiding in him. they will love and trust me, and be sure that i want them to be happy, and will not let them suffer more than is necessary: but as for going to him in the same way, they would never think of it. they are dreadfully afraid of him, if they think of him at all, which they generally only do when they have been naughty, and they look on all connected with him as very grave and dull: and, when they are full of fun and thoroughly happy, i am sure they unconsciously hope he is not looking. i am sure i don't wonder they think of him in this way, for people never talk of him in connection with what makes their little lives the brightest. if they are naughty, people put on solemn faces, and say he is very angry or shocked, or something which frightens them: and, for the rest, he is talked about only in a way that makes them think of church and having to be quiet. as for being taught that all joy and all gladness and brightness is his joy that he is wearying for them to be happy, and is not hard and stern, but always doing things to make their days brighter, and caring for them so tenderly, and wanting them to run to him with all their little joys and sorrows, they are not taught that. i do so long to make them trust him as they trust us, to feel that he will 'take their part' as they do with us in their little woes, and to go to him in their plays and enjoyments and not only when they say their prayers. i was quite grateful to one little dot, a short time ago, who said to his mother 'when i am in bed, i put out my hand to see if i can feel jesus and my angel. i thought perhaps in the dark they'd touch me, but they never have yet.' i do so want them to want to go to him, and to feel how, if he is there, it must be happy. let me add for i feel i have drifted into far too serious a vein for a preface to a fairy-tale the deliciously naive remark of a very dear child-friend, whom i asked, after an acquaintance of two or three days, if she had read 'alice' and the 'looking-glass.' oh yes, she replied readily, i've read both of them and i think (this more slowly and thoughtfully) i think 'through the looking-glass' is more stupid than 'alice's adventures.' don't you think so but this was a question i felt it would be hardly discreet for me to enter upon. please to fancy, if you can, that you are reading a real letter, from a real friend whom you have seen, and whose voice you can seem to yourself to hear wishing you, as i do now with all my heart, a happy easter. do you know that delicious dreamy feeling when one first wakes on a summer morning, with the twitter of birds in the air, and the fresh breeze coming in at the open window when, lying lazily with eyes half shut, one sees as in a dream green boughs waving, or waters rippling in a golden light it is a pleasure very near to sadness, bringing tears to one's eyes like a beautiful picture or poem. and is not that a mother's gentle hand that undraws your curtains, and a mother's sweet voice that summons you to rise to rise and forget, in the bright sunlight, the ugly dreams that frightened you so when all was dark to rise and enjoy another happy day, first kneeling to thank that unseen friend, who sends you the beautiful sun are these strange words from a writer of such tales as alice and is this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense it may be so. some perhaps may blame me for thus mixing together things grave and gay; others may smile and think it odd that any one should speak of solemn things at all, except in church and on a sunday: but i think nay, i am sure that some children will read this gently and lovingly, and in the spirit in which i have written it. for i do not believe god means us thus to divide life into two halves to wear a grave face on sunday, and to think it out-of-place to even so much as mention him on a week-day. do you think he cares to see only kneeling figures, and to hear only tones of prayer and that he does not also love to see the lambs leaping in the sunlight, and to hear the merry voices of the children, as they roll among the hay surely their innocent laughter is as sweet in his ears as the grandest anthem that ever rolled up from the dim religious light of some solemn cathedral and if i have written anything to add to those stores of innocent and healthy amusement that are laid up in books for the children i love so well, it is surely something i may hope to look back upon without shame and sorrow (as how much of life must then be recalled ) when my turn comes to walk through the valley of shadows. this easter sun will rise on you, dear child, feeling your life in every limb, and eager to rush out into the fresh morning air and many an easter-day will come and go, before it finds you feeble and gray-headed, creeping wearily out to bask once more in the sunlight but it is good, even now, to think sometimes of that great morning when the sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings. urely your gladness need not be the less for the thought that you will one day see a brighter dawn than this when lovelier sights will meet your eyes than any waving trees or rippling waters when angel-hands shall undraw your curtains, and sweeter tones than ever loving mother breathed shall wake you to a new and glorious day and when all the sadness, and the sin, that darkened life on this little earth, shall be forgotten like the dreams of a night that is past lady dear, if fairies may for a moment lay aside cunning tricks and elfish play, 'tis at happy christmas-tide. we have heard the children say gentle children, whom we love long ago, on christmas day, came a message from above. still, as christmas-tide comes round, they remember it again echo still the joyful sound peace on earth, good-will to men yet the hearts must childlike be where such heavenly guests abide: unto children, in their glee, all the year is christmas-tide thus, forgetting tricks and play for a moment, lady dear, we would wish you, if we may, merry christmas, glad new year one thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it: it was the black kitten's fault entirely. for the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn't have had any hand in the mischief. the way dinah washed her children's faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as i said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good. but the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, while alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle. 'oh, you wicked little thing ' cried alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. 'really, dinah ought to have taught you better manners you ought, dinah, you know you ought ' she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. but she didn't get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might. 'do you know what to-morrow is, kitty ' alice began. 'you'd have guessed if you'd been up in the window with me only dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn't. i was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire and it wants plenty of sticks, kitty only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. never mind, kitty, we'll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.' here alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten's neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again. 'do you know, i was so angry, kitty,' alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again, 'when i saw all the mischief you had been doing, i was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow and you'd have deserved it, you little mischievous darling what have you got to say for yourself now don't interrupt me ' she went on, holding up one finger. 'i'm going to tell you all your faults. number one: you squeaked twice while dinah was washing your face this morning. now you can't deny it, kitty: i heard you what's that you say ' (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) 'her paw went into your eye well, that's your fault, for keeping your eyes open if you'd shut them tight up, it wouldn't have happened. now don't make any more excuses, but listen number two: you pulled snowdrop away by the tail just as i had put down the saucer of milk before her what, you were thirsty, were you how do you know she wasn't thirsty too now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while i wasn't looking 'that's three faults, kitty, and you've not been punished for any of them yet. you know i'm saving up all your punishments for wednesday week suppose they had saved up all my punishments ' she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten. 'what would they do at the end of a year i should be sent to prison, i suppose, when the day came. or let me see suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, i should have to go without fifty dinners at once well, i shouldn't mind that much i'd far rather go without them than eat them 'do you hear the snow against the window-panes, kitty how nice and soft it sounds just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. i wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently and then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, 'go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.' and when they wake up in the summer, kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about whenever the wind blows oh, that's very pretty ' cried alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. 'and i do so wish it was true i'm sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown. 'kitty, can you play chess now, don't smile, my dear, i'm asking it seriously. because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when i said 'check ' you purred well, it was a nice check, kitty, and really i might have won, if it hadn't been for that nasty knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. kitty, dear, let's pretend ' and here i wish i could tell you half the things alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase 'let's pretend.' she had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before all because alice had begun with 'let's pretend we're kings and queens;' and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn't, because there were only two of them, and alice had been reduced at last to say, 'well, you can be one of them then, and i'll be all the rest.' and once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, 'nurse do let's pretend that i'm a hungry hyaena, and you're a bone.' but this is taking us away from alice's speech to the kitten. 'let's pretend that you're the red queen, kitty do you know, i think if you sat up and folded your arms, you'd look exactly like her. now do try, there's a dear ' and alice got the red queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didn't succeed, principally, alice said, because the kitten wouldn't fold its arms properly. so, to punish it, she held it up to the looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was 'and if you're not good directly,' she added, 'i'll put you through into looking-glass house. how would you like that ' 'now, if you'll only attend, kitty, and not talk so much, i'll tell you all my ideas about looking-glass house. first, there's the room you can see through the glass that's just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way. i can see all of it when i get upon a chair all but the bit behind the fireplace. oh i do so wish i could see that bit i want so much to know whether they've a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; i know that, because i've held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room. 'how would you like to live in looking-glass house, kitty i wonder if they'd give you milk in there perhaps looking-glass milk isn't good to drink but oh, kitty now we come to the passage. you can just see a little peep of the passage in looking-glass house, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and it's very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. oh, kitty how nice it would be if we could only get through into looking-glass house i'm sure it's got, oh such beautiful things in it let's pretend there's a way of getting through into it, somehow, kitty. let's pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. why, it's turning into a sort of mist now, i declare it'll be easy enough to get through ' she was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. and certainly the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist. in another moment alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the looking-glass room. the very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. 'so i shall be as warm here as i was in the old room,' thought alice: 'warmer, in fact, because there'll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. oh, what fun it'll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can't get at me ' then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible. for instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her. 'they don't keep this room so tidy as the other,' alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little 'oh ' of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. the chessmen were walking about, two and two 'here are the red king and the red queen,' alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), 'and there are the white king and the white queen sitting on the edge of the shovel and here are two castles walking arm in arm i don't think they can hear me,' she went on, as she put her head closer down, 'and i'm nearly sure they can't see me. i feel somehow as if i were invisible ' here something began squeaking on the table behind alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the white pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next. 'it is the voice of my child ' the white queen cried out as she rushed past the king, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. 'my precious lily my imperial kitten ' and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender. 'imperial fiddlestick ' said the king, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. he had a right to be a little annoyed with the queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot. alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter. the queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little lily in silence. as soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the white king, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, 'mind the volcano ' 'what volcano ' said the king, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one. 'blew me up,' panted the queen, who was still a little out of breath. 'mind you come up the regular way don't get blown up ' alice watched the white king as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said, 'why, you'll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. i'd far better help you, hadn't i ' but the king took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her. so alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the queen, that she mightn't take his breath away: but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes. she said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the king made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor. 'oh please don't make such faces, my dear ' she cried out, quite forgetting that the king couldn't hear her. 'you make me laugh so that i can hardly hold you and don't keep your mouth so wide open all the ashes will get into it there, now i think you're tidy enough ' she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the queen. the king immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. however, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the queen were talking together in a frightened whisper so low, that alice could hardly hear what they said. the king was saying, 'i assure, you my dear, i turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers ' to which the queen replied, 'you haven't got any whiskers.' 'the horror of that moment,' the king went on, 'i shall never, never forget ' 'you will, though,' the queen said, 'if you don't make a memorandum of it.' alice looked on with great interest as the king took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. a sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him. the poor king looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, 'my dear i really must get a thinner pencil. i can't manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that i don't intend ' 'what manner of things ' said the queen, looking over the book (in which alice had put 'the white knight is sliding down the poker. he balances very badly') 'that's not a memorandum of your feelings ' there was a book lying near alice on the table, and while she sat watching the white king (for she was still a little anxious about him, and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again), she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read, ' for it's all in some language i don't know,' she said to herself. it was like this. she puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck her. 'why, it's a looking-glass book, of course and if i hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right way again.' this was the poem that alice read. jabberwocky 'twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe; all mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgrabe. 'beware the jabberwock, my son the jaws that bite, the claws that catch beware the jubjub bird, and shun the frumious bandersnatch ' he took his vorpal sword in hand: long time the manxome foe he sought so rested he by the tumtum tree, and stood awhile in thought. and as in uffish thought he stood, the jabberwock, with eyes of flame, came whiffling through the tulgey wood, and burbled as it came one, two one, two and through and through the vorpal blade went snicker-snack he left it dead, and with its head he went galumphing back. 'and hast thou slain the jabberwock come to my arms, my beamish boy o frabjous day callooh callay ' he chortled in his joy. 'twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe; all mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgrabe. 'it seems very pretty,' she said when she had finished it, 'but it's rather hard to understand ' (you see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) 'somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas only i don't exactly know what they are however, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate ' 'but oh ' thought alice, suddenly jumping up, 'if i don't make haste i shall have to go back through the looking-glass, before i've seen what the rest of the house is like let's have a look at the garden first ' she was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairs or, at least, it wasn't exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down stairs quickly and easily, as alice said to herself. she just kept the tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without even touching the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if she hadn't caught hold of the door-post. she was getting a little giddy with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself walking again in the natural way. chapter ii. the garden of live flowers 'i should see the garden far better,' said alice to herself, 'if i could get to the top of that hill: and here's a path that leads straight to it at least, no, it doesn't do that ' (after going a few yards along the path, and turning several sharp corners), 'but i suppose it will at last. but how curiously it twists it's more like a corkscrew than a path well, this turn goes to the hill, i suppose no, it doesn't this goes straight back to the house well then, i'll try it the other way.' and so she did: wandering up and down, and trying turn after turn, but always coming back to the house, do what she would. indeed, once, when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it before she could stop herself. 'it's no use talking about it,' alice said, looking up at the house and pretending it was arguing with her. 'i'm not going in again yet. i know i should have to get through the looking-glass again back into the old room and there'd be an end of all my adventures ' so, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill. for a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, 'i really shall do it this time ' when the path gave a sudden twist and shook itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found herself actually walking in at the door. 'oh, it's too bad ' she cried. 'i never saw such a house for getting in the way never ' however, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be done but start again. this time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle. 'o tiger-lily,' said alice, addressing herself to one that was waving gracefully about in the wind, 'i wish you could talk ' 'we can talk,' said the tiger-lily: 'when there's anybody worth talking to.' alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite seemed to take her breath away. at length, as the tiger-lily only went on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice almost in a whisper. 'and can all the flowers talk ' 'as well as you can,' said the tiger-lily. 'and a great deal louder.' 'it isn't manners for us to begin, you know,' said the rose, 'and i really was wondering when you'd speak said i to myself, 'her face has got some sense in it, though it's not a clever one ' still, you're the right colour, and that goes a long way.' 'i don't care about the colour,' the tiger-lily remarked. 'if only her petals curled up a little more, she'd be all right.' alice didn't like being criticised, so she began asking questions. 'aren't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody to take care of you ' 'there's the tree in the middle,' said the rose: 'what else is it good for ' 'but what could it do, if any danger came ' alice asked. 'it says 'bough-wough '' cried a daisy: 'that's why its branches are called boughs ' 'didn't you know that ' cried another daisy, and here they all began shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices. 'silence, every one of you ' cried the tiger-lily, waving itself passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. 'they know i can't get at them ' it panted, bending its quivering head towards alice, 'or they wouldn't dare to do it ' 'never mind ' alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, 'if you don't hold your tongues, i'll pick you ' there was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned white. 'that's right ' said the tiger-lily. 'the daisies are worst of all. when one speaks, they all begin together, and it's enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on ' 'how is it you can all talk so nicely ' alice said, hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment. 'i've been in many gardens before, but none of the flowers could talk.' 'put your hand down, and feel the ground,' said the tiger-lily. 'then you'll know why.' alice did so. 'it's very hard,' she said, 'but i don't see what that has to do with it.' 'in most gardens,' the tiger-lily said, 'they make the beds too soft so that the flowers are always asleep.' this sounded a very good reason, and alice was quite pleased to know it. 'i never thought of that before ' she said. 'it's my opinion that you never think at all,' the rose said in a rather severe tone. 'i never saw anybody that looked stupider,' a violet said, so suddenly, that alice quite jumped; for it hadn't spoken before. 'hold your tongue ' cried the tiger-lily. 'as if you ever saw anybody you keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know no more what's going on in the world, than if you were a bud ' 'are there any more people in the garden besides me ' alice said, not choosing to notice the rose's last remark. 'there's one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,' said the rose. 'i wonder how you do it ' ('you're always wondering,' said the tiger-lily), 'but she's more bushy than you are.' 'is she like me ' alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind, 'there's another little girl in the garden, somewhere ' 'well, she has the same awkward shape as you,' the rose said, 'but she's redder and her petals are shorter, i think.' 'her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,' the tiger-lily interrupted: 'not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.' 'but that's not your fault,' the rose added kindly: 'you're beginning to fade, you know and then one can't help one's petals getting a little untidy.' alice didn't like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked 'does she ever come out here ' 'i daresay you'll see her soon,' said the rose. 'she's one of the thorny kind.' 'where does she wear the thorns ' alice asked with some curiosity. 'why all round her head, of course,' the rose replied. 'i was wondering you hadn't got some too. i thought it was the regular rule.' 'she's coming ' cried the larkspur. 'i hear her footstep, thump, thump, thump, along the gravel-walk ' alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the red queen. 'she's grown a good deal ' was her first remark. she had indeed: when alice first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high and here she was, half a head taller than alice herself 'it's the fresh air that does it,' said the rose: 'wonderfully fine air it is, out here.' 'i think i'll go and meet her,' said alice, for, though the flowers were interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk with a real queen. 'you can't possibly do that,' said the rose: ' i should advise you to walk the other way.' this sounded nonsense to alice, so she said nothing, but set off at once towards the red queen. to her surprise, she lost sight of her in a moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again. a little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction. it succeeded beautifully. she had not been walking a minute before she found herself face to face with the red queen, and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aiming at. 'where do you come from ' said the red queen. 'and where are you going look up, speak nicely, and don't twiddle your fingers all the time.' alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she could, that she had lost her way. 'i don't know what you mean by your way,' said the queen: 'all the ways about here belong to me but why did you come out here at all ' she added in a kinder tone. 'curtsey while you're thinking what to say, it saves time.' alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the queen to disbelieve it. 'i'll try it when i go home,' she thought to herself, 'the next time i'm a little late for dinner.' 'it's time for you to answer now,' the queen said, looking at her watch: 'open your mouth a little wider when you speak, and always say 'your majesty.'' 'i only wanted to see what the garden was like, your majesty ' 'that's right,' said the queen, patting her on the head, which alice didn't like at all, 'though, when you say 'garden,' i've seen gardens, compared with which this would be a wilderness.' alice didn't dare to argue the point, but went on: ' and i thought i'd try and find my way to the top of that hill ' 'when you say 'hill,'' the queen interrupted, ' i could show you hills, in comparison with which you'd call that a valley.' 'no, i shouldn't,' said alice, surprised into contradicting her at last: 'a hill can't be a valley, you know. that would be nonsense ' the red queen shook her head, 'you may call it 'nonsense' if you like,' she said, 'but i've heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary ' alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the queen's tone that she was a little offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to the top of the little hill. for some minutes alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions over the country and a most curious country it was. there were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook. 'i declare it's marked out just like a large chessboard ' alice said at last. 'there ought to be some men moving about somewhere and so there are ' she added in a tone of delight, and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on. 'it's a great huge game of chess that's being played all over the world if this is the world at all, you know. oh, what fun it is how i wish i was one of them i wouldn't mind being a pawn, if only i might join though of course i should like to be a queen, best.' she glanced rather shyly at the real queen as she said this, but her companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, 'that's easily managed. you can be the white queen's pawn, if you like, as lily's too young to play; and you're in the second square to begin with: when you get to the eighth square you'll be a queen ' just at this moment, somehow or other, they began to run. alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and the queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her: and still the queen kept crying 'faster faster ' but alice felt she could not go faster, though she had not breath left to say so. the most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything. 'i wonder if all the things move along with us ' thought poor puzzled alice. and the queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, 'faster don't try to talk ' not that alice had any idea of doing that. she felt as if she would never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and still the queen cried 'faster faster ' and dragged her along. 'are we nearly there ' alice managed to pant out at last. 'nearly there ' the queen repeated. 'why, we passed it ten minutes ago faster ' and they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling in alice's ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied. 'now now ' cried the queen. 'faster faster ' and they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as alice was getting quite exhausted, they stopped, and she found herself sitting on the ground, breathless and giddy. the queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, 'you may rest a little now.' alice looked round her in great surprise. 'why, i do believe we've been under this tree the whole time everything's just as it was ' 'of course it is,' said the queen, 'what would you have it ' 'well, in our country,' said alice, still panting a little, 'you'd generally get to somewhere else if you ran very fast for a long time, as we've been doing.' 'a slow sort of country ' said the queen. 'now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. if you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that ' 'i'd rather not try, please ' said alice. 'i'm quite content to stay here only i am so hot and thirsty ' 'i know what you'd like ' the queen said good-naturedly, taking a little box out of her pocket. 'have a biscuit ' alice thought it would not be civil to say 'no,' though it wasn't at all what she wanted. so she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it was very dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all her life. 'while you're refreshing yourself,' said the queen, 'i'll just take the measurements.' and she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here and there. 'at the end of two yards,' she said, putting in a peg to mark the distance, 'i shall give you your directions have another biscuit ' 'no, thank you,' said alice: 'one's quite enough ' 'thirst quenched, i hope ' said the queen. alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the queen did not wait for an answer, but went on. 'at the end of three yards i shall repeat them for fear of your forgetting them. at the end of four, i shall say good-bye. and at the end of five, i shall go ' she had got all the pegs put in by this time, and alice looked on with great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly walking down the row. at the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, 'a pawn goes two squares in its first move, you know. so you'll go very quickly through the third square by railway, i should think and you'll find yourself in the fourth square in no time. well, that square belongs to tweedledum and tweedledee the fifth is mostly water the sixth belongs to humpty dumpty but you make no remark ' 'i i didn't know i had to make one just then,' alice faltered out. 'you should have said, 'it's extremely kind of you to tell me all this' however, we'll suppose it said the seventh square is all forest however, one of the knights will show you the way and in the eighth square we shall be queens together, and it's all feasting and fun ' alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again. at the next peg the queen turned again, and this time she said, 'speak in french when you can't think of the english for a thing turn out your toes as you walk and remember who you are ' she did not wait for alice to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she turned for a moment to say 'good-bye,' and then hurried on to the last. how it happened, alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last peg, she was gone. whether she vanished into the air, or whether she ran quickly into the wood ('and she can run very fast ' thought alice), there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and alice began to remember that she was a pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to move. of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the country she was going to travel through. 'it's something very like learning geography,' thought alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able to see a little further. 'principal rivers there are none. principal mountains i'm on the only one, but i don't think it's got any name. principal towns why, what are those creatures, making honey down there they can't be bees nobody ever saw bees a mile off, you know ' and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that was bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them, 'just as if it was a regular bee,' thought alice. however, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an elephant as alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath away at first. 'and what enormous flowers they must be ' was her next idea. 'something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put to them and what quantities of honey they must make i think i'll go down and no, i won't just yet,' she went on, checking herself just as she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly. 'it'll never do to go down among them without a good long branch to brush them away and what fun it'll be when they ask me how i like my walk. i shall say 'oh, i like it well enough '' (here came the favourite little toss of the head), ''only it was so dusty and hot, and the elephants did tease so '' 'i think i'll go down the other way,' she said after a pause: 'and perhaps i may visit the elephants later on. besides, i do so want to get into the third square ' so with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of the six little brooks. 'tickets, please ' said the guard, putting his head in at the window. in a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the same size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage. 'now then show your ticket, child ' the guard went on, looking angrily at alice. and a great many voices all said together ('like the chorus of a song,' thought alice), 'don't keep him waiting, child why, his time is worth a thousand pounds a minute ' 'i'm afraid i haven't got one,' alice said in a frightened tone: 'there wasn't a ticket-office where i came from.' and again the chorus of voices went on. 'there wasn't room for one where she came from. the land there is worth a thousand pounds an inch ' 'don't make excuses,' said the guard: 'you should have bought one from the engine-driver.' and once more the chorus of voices went on with 'the man that drives the engine. why, the smoke alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff ' alice thought to herself, 'then there's no use in speaking.' the voices didn't join in this time, as she hadn't spoken, but to her great surprise, they all thought in chorus (i hope you understand what thinking in chorus means for i must confess that i don't), 'better say nothing at all. language is worth a thousand pounds a word ' 'i shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, i know i shall ' thought alice. all this time the guard was looking at her, first through a telescope, then through a microscope, and then through an opera-glass. at last he said, 'you're travelling the wrong way,' and shut up the window and went away. 'so young a child,' said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was dressed in white paper), 'ought to know which way she's going, even if she doesn't know her own name ' a goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his eyes and said in a loud voice, 'she ought to know her way to the ticket-office, even if she doesn't know her alphabet ' there was a beetle sitting next to the goat (it was a very queer carriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be that they should all speak in turn, he went on with 'she'll have to go back from here as luggage ' alice couldn't see who was sitting beyond the beetle, but a hoarse voice spoke next. 'change engines ' it said, and was obliged to leave off. 'it sounds like a horse,' alice thought to herself. and an extremely small voice, close to her ear, said, 'you might make a joke on that something about 'horse' and 'hoarse,' you know.' then a very gentle voice in the distance said, 'she must be labelled 'lass, with care,' you know ' and after that other voices went on ('what a number of people there are in the carriage ' thought alice), saying, 'she must go by post, as she's got a head on her ' 'she must be sent as a message by the telegraph ' 'she must draw the train herself the rest of the way ' and so on. but the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered in her ear, 'never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a return-ticket every time the train stops.' 'indeed i shan't ' alice said rather impatiently. 'i don't belong to this railway journey at all i was in a wood just now and i wish i could get back there.' 'you might make a joke on that,' said the little voice close to her ear: 'something about 'you would if you could,' you know.' 'don't tease so,' said alice, looking about in vain to see where the voice came from; 'if you're so anxious to have a joke made, why don't you make one yourself ' the little voice sighed deeply: it was very unhappy, evidently, and alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, 'if it would only sigh like other people ' she thought. but this was such a wonderfully small sigh, that she wouldn't have heard it at all, if it hadn't come quite close to her ear. the consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature. 'i know you are a friend,' the little voice went on; 'a dear friend, and an old friend. and you won't hurt me, though i am an insect.' 'what kind of insect ' alice inquired a little anxiously. what she really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she thought this wouldn't be quite a civil question to ask. 'what, then you don't ' the little voice began, when it was drowned by a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm, alice among the rest. the horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in and said, 'it's only a brook we have to jump over.' everybody seemed satisfied with this, though alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all. 'however, it'll take us into the fourth square, that's some comfort ' she said to herself. in another moment she felt the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she caught at the thing nearest to her hand, which happened to be the goat's beard. but the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she found herself sitting quietly under a tree while the gnat (for that was the insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over her head, and fanning her with its wings. it certainly was a very large gnat: 'about the size of a chicken,' alice thought. still, she couldn't feel nervous with it, after they had been talking together so long. ' then you don't like all insects ' the gnat went on, as quietly as if nothing had happened. 'i like them when they can talk,' alice said. 'none of them ever talk, where i come from.' 'what sort of insects do you rejoice in, where you come from ' the gnat inquired. 'i don't rejoice in insects at all,' alice explained, 'because i'm rather afraid of them at least the large kinds. but i can tell you the names of some of them.' 'of course they answer to their names ' the gnat remarked carelessly. 'i never knew them to do it.' 'what's the use of their having names,' the gnat said, 'if they won't answer to them ' 'no use to them,' said alice; 'but it's useful to the people who name them, i suppose. if not, why do things have names at all ' 'i can't say,' the gnat replied. 'further on, in the wood down there, they've got no names however, go on with your list of insects: you're wasting time.' 'well, there's the horse-fly,' alice began, counting off the names on her fingers. 'all right,' said the gnat: 'half way up that bush, you'll see a rocking-horse-fly, if you look. it's made entirely of wood, and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch.' 'what does it live on ' alice asked, with great curiosity. 'sap and sawdust,' said the gnat. 'go on with the list.' alice looked up at the rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright and sticky; and then she went on. 'and there's the dragon-fly.' 'look on the branch above your head,' said the gnat, 'and there you'll find a snap-dragon-fly. its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.' 'and what does it live on ' 'frumenty and mince pie,' the gnat replied; 'and it makes its nest in a christmas box.' 'and then there's the butterfly,' alice went on, after she had taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to herself, 'i wonder if that's the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles because they want to turn into snap-dragon-flies ' 'crawling at your feet,' said the gnat (alice drew her feet back in some alarm), 'you may observe a bread-and-butterfly. its wings are thin slices of bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump of sugar.' 'and what does it live on ' 'weak tea with cream in it.' a new difficulty came into alice's head. 'supposing it couldn't find any ' she suggested. 'then it would die, of course.' 'but that must happen very often,' alice remarked thoughtfully. 'it always happens,' said the gnat. after this, alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. the gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last it settled again and remarked, 'i suppose you don't want to lose your name ' 'no, indeed,' alice said, a little anxiously. 'and yet i don't know,' the gnat went on in a careless tone: 'only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it for instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, she would call out 'come here ,' and there she would have to leave off, because there wouldn't be any name for her to call, and of course you wouldn't have to go, you know.' 'that would never do, i'm sure,' said alice: 'the governess would never think of excusing me lessons for that. if she couldn't remember my name, she'd call me 'miss ' as the servants do.' 'well, if she said 'miss,' and didn't say anything more,' the gnat remarked, 'of course you'd miss your lessons. that's a joke. i wish you had made it.' 'why do you wish i had made it ' alice asked. 'it's a very bad one.' but the gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down its cheeks. 'you shouldn't make jokes,' alice said, 'if it makes you so unhappy.' then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the poor gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when alice looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and walked on. she very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and alice felt a little timid about going into it. however, on second thoughts, she made up her mind to go on: 'for i certainly won't go back,' she thought to herself, and this was the only way to the eighth square. 'this must be the wood,' she said thoughtfully to herself, 'where things have no names. i wonder what'll become of my name when i go in i shouldn't like to lose it at all because they'd have to give me another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. but then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name that's just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose dogs 'answers to the name of 'dash:' had on a brass collar' just fancy calling everything you met 'alice,' till one of them answered only they wouldn't answer at all, if they were wise.' she was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked very cool and shady. 'well, at any rate it's a great comfort,' she said as she stepped under the trees, 'after being so hot, to get into the into what ' she went on, rather surprised at not being able to think of the word. 'i mean to get under the under the under this, you know ' putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. 'what does it call itself, i wonder i do believe it's got no name why, to be sure it hasn't ' she stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again. 'then it really has happened, after all and now, who am i i will remember, if i can i'm determined to do it ' but being determined didn't help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of puzzling, was, 'l, i know it begins with l ' just then a fawn came wandering by: it looked at alice with its large gentle eyes, but didn't seem at all frightened. 'here then here then ' alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it only started back a little, and then stood looking at her again. 'what do you call yourself ' the fawn said at last. such a soft sweet voice it had 'i wish i knew ' thought poor alice. she answered, rather sadly, 'nothing, just now.' 'think again,' it said: 'that won't do.' alice thought, but nothing came of it. 'please, would you tell me what you call yourself ' she said timidly. 'i think that might help a little.' 'i'll tell you, if you'll move a little further on,' the fawn said. 'i can't remember here.' so they walked on together though the wood, alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the fawn, till they came out into another open field, and here the fawn gave a sudden bound into the air, and shook itself free from alice's arms. 'i'm a fawn ' it cried out in a voice of delight, 'and, dear me you're a human child ' a sudden look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had darted away at full speed. alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. 'however, i know my name now.' she said, 'that's some comfort. alice alice i won't forget it again. and now, which of these finger-posts ought i to follow, i wonder ' it was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it. 'i'll settle it,' alice said to herself, 'when the road divides and they point different ways.' but this did not seem likely to happen. she went on and on, a long way, but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts pointing the same way, one marked 'to tweedledum's house' and the other 'to the house of tweedledee.' 'i do believe,' said alice at last, 'that they live in the same house i wonder i never thought of that before but i can't stay there long. i'll just call and say 'how d'you do ' and ask them the way out of the wood. if i could only get to the eighth square before it gets dark ' so she wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not help starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling sure that they must be. they were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other's neck, and alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them had 'dum' embroidered on his collar, and the other 'dee.' 'i suppose they've each got 'tweedle' round at the back of the collar,' she said to herself. they stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was just looking round to see if the word 'tweedle' was written at the back of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one marked 'dum.' 'if you think we're wax-works,' he said, 'you ought to pay, you know. wax-works weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow ' 'contrariwise,' added the one marked 'dee,' 'if you think we're alive, you ought to speak.' 'i'm sure i'm very sorry,' was all alice could say; for the words of the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock, and she could hardly help saying them out loud: 'tweedledum and tweedledee agreed to have a battle; for tweedledum said tweedledee had spoiled his nice new rattle. just then flew down a monstrous crow, as black as a tar-barrel; which frightened both the heroes so, they quite forgot their quarrel.' 'i know what you're thinking about,' said tweedledum: 'but it isn't so, nohow.' 'contrariwise,' continued tweedledee, 'if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't. that's logic.' 'i was thinking,' alice said very politely, 'which is the best way out of this wood: it's getting so dark. would you tell me, please ' but the little men only looked at each other and grinned. they looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that alice couldn't help pointing her finger at tweedledum, and saying 'first boy ' 'nohow ' tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again with a snap. 'next boy ' said alice, passing on to tweedledee, though she felt quite certain he would only shout out 'contrariwise ' and so he did. 'you've been wrong ' cried tweedledum. 'the first thing in a visit is to say 'how d'ye do ' and shake hands ' and here the two brothers gave each other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free, to shake hands with her. alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear of hurting the other one's feelings; so, as the best way out of the difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they were dancing round in a ring. this seemed quite natural (she remembered afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks. 'but it certainly was funny,' (alice said afterwards, when she was telling her sister the history of all this,) 'to find myself singing 'here we go round the mulberry bush.' i don't know when i began it, but somehow i felt as if i'd been singing it a long long time ' the other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. 'four times round is enough for one dance,' tweedledum panted out, and they left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same moment. then they let go of alice's hands, and stood looking at her for a minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as alice didn't know how to begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. 'it would never do to say 'how d'ye do ' now,' she said to herself: 'we seem to have got beyond that, somehow ' 'i hope you're not much tired ' she said at last. 'nohow. and thank you very much for asking,' said tweedledum. 'so much obliged ' added tweedledee. 'you like poetry ' 'ye-es, pretty well some poetry,' alice said doubtfully. 'would you tell me which road leads out of the wood ' 'what shall i repeat to her ' said tweedledee, looking round at tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing alice's question. ''the walrus and the carpenter' is the longest,' tweedledum replied, giving his brother an affectionate hug. tweedledee began instantly: 'the sun was shining ' here alice ventured to interrupt him. 'if it's very long,' she said, as politely as she could, 'would you please tell me first which road ' tweedledee smiled gently, and began again: 'the sun was shining on the sea, shining with all his might: he did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright and this was odd, because it was the middle of the night. the moon was shining sulkily, because she thought the sun had got no business to be there after the day was done 'it's very rude of him,' she said, 'to come and spoil the fun ' the sea was wet as wet could be, the sands were dry as dry. you could not see a cloud, because no cloud was in the sky: no birds were flying over head there were no birds to fly. the walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand; they wept like anything to see such quantities of sand: 'if this were only cleared away,' they said, 'it would be grand ' 'if seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year, do you suppose,' the walrus said, 'that they could get it clear ' 'i doubt it,' said the carpenter, and shed a bitter tear. 'o oysters, come and walk with us ' the walrus did beseech. 'a pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, along the briny beach: we cannot do with more than four, to give a hand to each.' the eldest oyster looked at him. but never a word he said: the eldest oyster winked his eye, and shook his heavy head meaning to say he did not choose to leave the oyster-bed. but four young oysters hurried up, all eager for the treat: their coats were brushed, their faces washed, their shoes were clean and neat and this was odd, because, you know, they hadn't any feet. four other oysters followed them, and yet another four; and thick and fast they came at last, and more, and more, and more all hopping through the frothy waves, and scrambling to the shore. the walrus and the carpenter walked on a mile or so, and then they rested on a rock conveniently low: and all the little oysters stood and waited in a row. 'the time has come,' the walrus said, 'to talk of many things: of shoes and ships and sealing-wax of cabbages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings.' 'but wait a bit,' the oysters cried, 'before we have our chat; for some of us are out of breath, and all of us are fat ' 'no hurry ' said the carpenter. they thanked him much for that. 'a loaf of bread,' the walrus said, 'is what we chiefly need: pepper and vinegar besides are very good indeed now if you're ready oysters dear, we can begin to feed.' 'but not on us ' the oysters cried, turning a little blue, 'after such kindness, that would be a dismal thing to do ' 'the night is fine,' the walrus said 'do you admire the view 'it was so kind of you to come and you are very nice ' the carpenter said nothing but 'cut us another slice: i wish you were not quite so deaf i've had to ask you twice ' 'it seems a shame,' the walrus said, 'to play them such a trick, after we've brought them out so far, and made them trot so quick ' the carpenter said nothing but 'the butter's spread too thick ' 'i weep for you,' the walrus said. 'i deeply sympathize.' with sobs and tears he sorted out those of the largest size. holding his pocket handkerchief before his streaming eyes. 'o oysters,' said the carpenter. 'you've had a pleasant run shall we be trotting home again ' but answer came there none and that was scarcely odd, because they'd eaten every one.' 'i like the walrus best,' said alice: 'because you see he was a little sorry for the poor oysters.' 'he ate more than the carpenter, though,' said tweedledee. 'you see he held his handkerchief in front, so that the carpenter couldn't count how many he took: contrariwise.' 'that was mean ' alice said indignantly. 'then i like the carpenter best if he didn't eat so many as the walrus.' 'but he ate as many as he could get,' said tweedledum. this was a puzzler. after a pause, alice began, 'well they were both very unpleasant characters ' here she checked herself in some alarm, at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely to be a wild beast. 'are there any lions or tigers about here ' she asked timidly. 'it's only the red king snoring,' said tweedledee. 'come and look at him ' the brothers cried, and they each took one of alice's hands, and led her up to where the king was sleeping. 'isn't he a lovely sight ' said tweedledum. alice couldn't say honestly that he was. he had a tall red night-cap on, with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap, and snoring loud 'fit to snore his head off ' as tweedledum remarked. 'i'm afraid he'll catch cold with lying on the damp grass,' said alice, who was a very thoughtful little girl. 'he's dreaming now,' said tweedledee: 'and what do you think he's dreaming about ' alice said 'nobody can guess that.' 'why, about you ' tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands triumphantly. 'and if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be ' 'where i am now, of course,' said alice. 'not you ' tweedledee retorted contemptuously. 'you'd be nowhere. why, you're only a sort of thing in his dream ' 'if that there king was to wake,' added tweedledum, 'you'd go out bang just like a candle ' 'i shouldn't ' alice exclaimed indignantly. 'besides, if i'm only a sort of thing in his dream, what are you, i should like to know ' 'ditto' said tweedledum. 'ditto, ditto' cried tweedledee. he shouted this so loud that alice couldn't help saying, 'hush you'll be waking him, i'm afraid, if you make so much noise.' 'well, it no use your talking about waking him,' said tweedledum, 'when you're only one of the things in his dream. you know very well you're not real.' 'i am real ' said alice and began to cry. 'you won't make yourself a bit realler by crying,' tweedledee remarked: 'there's nothing to cry about.' 'if i wasn't real,' alice said half-laughing through her tears, it all seemed so ridiculous 'i shouldn't be able to cry.' 'i hope you don't suppose those are real tears ' tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great contempt. 'i know they're talking nonsense,' alice thought to herself: 'and it's foolish to cry about it.' so she brushed away her tears, and went on as cheerfully as she could. 'at any rate i'd better be getting out of the wood, for really it's coming on very dark. do you think it's going to rain ' tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and looked up into it. 'no, i don't think it is,' he said: 'at least not under here. nohow.' 'but it may rain outside ' 'it may if it chooses,' said tweedledee: 'we've no objection. contrariwise.' 'selfish things ' thought alice, and she was just going to say 'good-night' and leave them, when tweedledum sprang out from under the umbrella and seized her by the wrist. 'do you see that ' he said, in a voice choking with passion, and his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree. 'it's only a rattle,' alice said, after a careful examination of the little white thing. 'not a rattlesnake, you know,' she added hastily, thinking that he was frightened: 'only an old rattle quite old and broken.' 'i knew it was ' cried tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and tear his hair. 'it's spoilt, of course ' here he looked at tweedledee, who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under the umbrella. alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, 'you needn't be so angry about an old rattle.' 'but it isn't old ' tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever. 'it's new, i tell you i bought it yesterday my nice new rattle ' and his voice rose to a perfect scream. all this time tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella, with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it quite took off alice's attention from the angry brother. but he couldn't quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting his mouth and his large eyes 'looking more like a fish than anything else,' alice thought. 'of course you agree to have a battle ' tweedledum said in a calmer tone. 'i suppose so,' the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the umbrella: 'only she must help us to dress up, you know.' so the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned in a minute with their arms full of things such as bolsters, blankets, hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. 'i hope you're a good hand at pinning and tying strings ' tweedledum remarked. 'every one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other.' alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything in all her life the way those two bustled about and the quantity of things they put on and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and fastening buttons 'really they'll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else, by the time they're ready ' she said to herself, as she arranged a bolster round the neck of tweedledee, 'to keep his head from being cut off,' as he said. 'you know,' he added very gravely, 'it's one of the most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battle to get one's head cut off.' alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear of hurting his feelings. 'do i look very pale ' said tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet tied on. (he called it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more like a saucepan.) 'well yes a little,' alice replied gently. 'i'm very brave generally,' he went on in a low voice: 'only to-day i happen to have a headache.' 'and i've got a toothache ' said tweedledee, who had overheard the remark. 'i'm far worse off than you ' 'then you'd better not fight to-day,' said alice, thinking it a good opportunity to make peace. 'we must have a bit of a fight, but i don't care about going on long,' said tweedledum. 'what's the time now ' tweedledee looked at his watch, and said 'half-past four.' 'let's fight till six, and then have dinner,' said tweedledum. 'very well,' the other said, rather sadly: 'and she can watch us only you'd better not come very close,' he added: 'i generally hit everything i can see when i get really excited.' 'and i hit everything within reach,' cried tweedledum, 'whether i can see it or not ' alice laughed. 'you must hit the trees pretty often, i should think,' she said. tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. 'i don't suppose,' he said, 'there'll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by the time we've finished ' 'and all about a rattle ' said alice, still hoping to make them a little ashamed of fighting for such a trifle. 'i shouldn't have minded it so much,' said tweedledum, 'if it hadn't been a new one.' 'i wish the monstrous crow would come ' thought alice. 'there's only one sword, you know,' tweedledum said to his brother: 'but you can have the umbrella it's quite as sharp. only we must begin quick. it's getting as dark as it can.' 'and darker,' said tweedledee. it was getting dark so suddenly that alice thought there must be a thunderstorm coming on. 'what a thick black cloud that is ' she said. 'and how fast it comes why, i do believe it's got wings ' 'it's the crow ' tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment. alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree. 'it can never get at me here,' she thought: 'it's far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees. but i wish it wouldn't flap its wings so it makes quite a hurricane in the wood here's somebody's shawl being blown away ' she caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in another moment the white queen came running wildly through the wood, with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and alice very civilly went to meet her with the shawl. 'i'm very glad i happened to be in the way,' alice said, as she helped her to put on her shawl again. the white queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way, and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like 'bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,' and alice felt that if there was to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. so she began rather timidly: 'am i addressing the white queen ' 'well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,' the queen said. 'it isn't my notion of the thing, at all.' alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very beginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, 'if your majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, i'll do it as well as i can.' 'but i don't want it done at all ' groaned the poor queen. 'i've been a-dressing myself for the last two hours.' it would have been all the better, as it seemed to alice, if she had got some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy. 'every single thing's crooked,' alice thought to herself, 'and she's all over pins may i put your shawl straight for you ' she added aloud. 'i don't know what's the matter with it ' the queen said, in a melancholy voice. 'it's out of temper, i think. i've pinned it here, and i've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it ' 'it can't go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side,' alice said, as she gently put it right for her; 'and, dear me, what a state your hair is in ' 'the brush has got entangled in it ' the queen said with a sigh. 'and i lost the comb yesterday.' alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair into order. 'come, you look rather better now ' she said, after altering most of the pins. 'but really you should have a lady's maid ' 'i'm sure i'll take you with pleasure ' the queen said. 'twopence a week, and jam every other day.' alice couldn't help laughing, as she said, 'i don't want you to hire me and i don't care for jam.' 'it's very good jam,' said the queen. 'well, i don't want any to-day, at any rate.' 'you couldn't have it if you did want it,' the queen said. 'the rule is, jam to-morrow and jam yesterday but never jam to-day.' 'it must come sometimes to 'jam to-day,'' alice objected. 'no, it can't,' said the queen. 'it's jam every other day: to-day isn't any other day, you know.' 'i don't understand you,' said alice. 'it's dreadfully confusing ' 'that's the effect of living backwards,' the queen said kindly: 'it always makes one a little giddy at first ' 'living backwards ' alice repeated in great astonishment. 'i never heard of such a thing ' ' but there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both ways.' 'i'm sure mine only works one way,' alice remarked. 'i can't remember things before they happen.' 'it's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,' the queen remarked. 'what sort of things do you remember best ' alice ventured to ask. 'oh, things that happened the week after next,' the queen replied in a careless tone. 'for instance, now,' she went on, sticking a large piece of plaster on her finger as she spoke, 'there's the king's messenger. he's in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn't even begin till next wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of all.' 'suppose he never commits the crime ' said alice. 'that would be all the better, wouldn't it ' the queen said, as she bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon. alice felt there was no denying that. 'of course it would be all the better,' she said: 'but it wouldn't be all the better his being punished.' 'you're wrong there, at any rate,' said the queen: 'were you ever punished ' 'only for faults,' said alice. 'and you were all the better for it, i know ' the queen said triumphantly. 'yes, but then i had done the things i was punished for,' said alice: 'that makes all the difference.' 'but if you hadn't done them,' the queen said, 'that would have been better still; better, and better, and better ' her voice went higher with each 'better,' till it got quite to a squeak at last. alice was just beginning to say 'there's a mistake somewhere ,' when the queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence unfinished. 'oh, oh, oh ' shouted the queen, shaking her hand about as if she wanted to shake it off. 'my finger's bleeding oh, oh, oh, oh ' her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that alice had to hold both her hands over her ears. 'what is the matter ' she said, as soon as there was a chance of making herself heard. 'have you pricked your finger ' 'i haven't pricked it yet,' the queen said, 'but i soon shall oh, oh, oh ' 'when do you expect to do it ' alice asked, feeling very much inclined to laugh. 'when i fasten my shawl again,' the poor queen groaned out: 'the brooch will come undone directly. oh, oh ' as she said the words the brooch flew open, and the queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it again. 'take care ' cried alice. 'you're holding it all crooked ' and she caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the queen had pricked her finger. 'that accounts for the bleeding, you see,' she said to alice with a smile. 'now you understand the way things happen here.' 'but why don't you scream now ' alice asked, holding her hands ready to put over her ears again. 'why, i've done all the screaming already,' said the queen. 'what would be the good of having it all over again ' by this time it was getting light. 'the crow must have flown away, i think,' said alice: 'i'm so glad it's gone. i thought it was the night coming on.' 'i wish i could manage to be glad ' the queen said. 'only i never can remember the rule. you must be very happy, living in this wood, and being glad whenever you like ' 'only it is so very lonely here ' alice said in a melancholy voice; and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her cheeks. 'oh, don't go on like that ' cried the poor queen, wringing her hands in despair. 'consider what a great girl you are. consider what a long way you've come to-day. consider what o'clock it is. consider anything, only don't cry ' alice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears. 'can you keep from crying by considering things ' she asked. 'that's the way it's done,' the queen said with great decision: 'nobody can do two things at once, you know. let's consider your age to begin with how old are you ' 'i'm seven and a half exactly.' 'you needn't say 'exactually,'' the queen remarked: 'i can believe it without that. now i'll give you something to believe. i'm just one hundred and one, five months and a day.' 'i can't believe that ' said alice. 'can't you ' the queen said in a pitying tone. 'try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.' alice laughed. 'there's no use trying,' she said: 'one can't believe impossible things.' 'i daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the queen. 'when i was your age, i always did it for half-an-hour a day. why, sometimes i've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. there goes the shawl again ' the brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew the queen's shawl across a little brook. the queen spread out her arms again, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in catching it for herself. 'i've got it ' she cried in a triumphant tone. 'now you shall see me pin it on again, all by myself ' 'then i hope your finger is better now ' alice said very politely, as she crossed the little brook after the queen. 'oh, much better ' cried the queen, her voice rising to a squeak as she went on. 'much be-etter be-etter be-e-e-etter be-e-ehh ' the last word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that alice quite started. she looked at the queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool. alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. she couldn't make out what had happened at all. was she in a shop and was that really was it really a sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter rub as she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was an old sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles. 'what is it you want to buy ' the sheep said at last, looking up for a moment from her knitting. 'i don't quite know yet,' alice said, very gently. 'i should like to look all round me first, if i might.' 'you may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,' said the sheep: 'but you can't look all round you unless you've got eyes at the back of your head.' but these, as it happened, alice had not got: so she contented herself with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them. the shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things but the oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf, to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold. 'things flow about so here ' she said at last in a plaintive tone, after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing, that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box, and was always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at. 'and this one is the most provoking of all but i'll tell you what ' she added, as a sudden thought struck her, 'i'll follow it up to the very top shelf of all. it'll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, i expect ' but even this plan failed: the 'thing' went through the ceiling as quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it. 'are you a child or a teetotum ' the sheep said, as she took up another pair of needles. 'you'll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round like that.' she was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and alice couldn't help looking at her in great astonishment. 'how can she knit with so many ' the puzzled child thought to herself. 'she gets more and more like a porcupine every minute ' 'can you row ' the sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles as she spoke. 'yes, a little but not on land and not with needles ' alice was beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best. 'feather ' cried the sheep, as she took up another pair of needles. this didn't sound like a remark that needed any answer, so alice said nothing, but pulled away. there was something very queer about the water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and would hardly come out again. 'feather feather ' the sheep cried again, taking more needles. 'you'll be catching a crab directly.' 'a dear little crab ' thought alice. 'i should like that.' 'didn't you hear me say 'feather' ' the sheep cried angrily, taking up quite a bunch of needles. 'indeed i did,' said alice: 'you've said it very often and very loud. please, where are the crabs ' 'in the water, of course ' said the sheep, sticking some of the needles into her hair, as her hands were full. 'feather, i say ' 'why do you say 'feather' so often ' alice asked at last, rather vexed. 'i'm not a bird ' 'you are,' said the sheep: 'you're a little goose.' this offended alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever), and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks frowning over their heads. 'oh, please there are some scented rushes ' alice cried in a sudden transport of delight. 'there really are and such beauties ' 'you needn't say 'please' to me about 'em,' the sheep said, without looking up from her knitting: 'i didn't put 'em there, and i'm not going to take 'em away.' 'no, but i meant please, may we wait and pick some ' alice pleaded. 'if you don't mind stopping the boat for a minute.' 'how am i to stop it ' said the sheep. 'if you leave off rowing, it'll stop of itself.' so the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it glided gently in among the waving rushes. and then the little sleeves were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off and for a while alice forgot all about the sheep and the knitting, as she bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the water while with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes. 'i only hope the boat won't tipple over ' she said to herself. 'oh, what a lovely one only i couldn't quite reach it.' 'and it certainly did seem a little provoking ('almost as if it happened on purpose,' she thought) that, though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as the boat glided by, there was always a more lovely one that she couldn't reach. 'the prettiest are always further ' she said at last, with a sigh at the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed cheeks and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place, and began to arrange her new-found treasures. what mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade, and to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she picked them even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very little while and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, as they lay in heaps at her feet but alice hardly noticed this, there were so many other curious things to think about. they hadn't gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got fast in the water and wouldn't come out again (so alice explained it afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of 'oh, oh, oh ' from poor alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among the heap of rushes. however, she wasn't hurt, and was soon up again: the sheep went on with her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. 'that was a nice crab you caught ' she remarked, as alice got back into her place, very much relieved to find herself still in the boat. 'was it i didn't see it,' said alice, peeping cautiously over the side of the boat into the dark water. 'i wish it hadn't let go i should so like to see a little crab to take home with me ' but the sheep only laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting. 'are there many crabs here ' said alice. 'crabs, and all sorts of things,' said the sheep: 'plenty of choice, only make up your mind. now, what do you want to buy ' 'to buy ' alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half frightened for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop. 'i should like to buy an egg, please,' she said timidly. 'how do you sell them ' 'fivepence farthing for one twopence for two,' the sheep replied. 'then two are cheaper than one ' alice said in a surprised tone, taking out her purse. 'only you must eat them both, if you buy two,' said the sheep. 'then i'll have one, please,' said alice, as she put the money down on the counter. for she thought to herself, 'they mightn't be at all nice, you know.' the sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said 'i never put things into people's hands that would never do you must get it for yourself.' and so saying, she went off to the other end of the shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf. 'i wonder why it wouldn't do ' thought alice, as she groped her way among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the end. 'the egg seems to get further away the more i walk towards it. let me see, is this a chair why, it's got branches, i declare how very odd to find trees growing here and actually here's a little brook well, this is the very queerest shop i ever saw ' so she went on, wondering more and more at every step, as everything turned into a tree the moment she came up to it, and she quite expected the egg to do the same. chapter vi. humpty dumpty however, the egg only got larger and larger, and more and more human: when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it, she saw clearly that it was humpty dumpty himself. 'it can't be anybody else ' she said to herself. 'i'm as certain of it, as if his name were written all over his face.' it might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous face. humpty dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a turk, on the top of a high wall such a narrow one that alice quite wondered how he could keep his balance and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction, and he didn't take the least notice of her, she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all. 'and how exactly like an egg he is ' she said aloud, standing with her hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to fall. 'it's very provoking,' humpty dumpty said after a long silence, looking away from alice as he spoke, 'to be called an egg very ' 'i said you looked like an egg, sir,' alice gently explained. 'and some eggs are very pretty, you know' she added, hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment. 'some people,' said humpty dumpty, looking away from her as usual, 'have no more sense than a baby ' alice didn't know what to say to this: it wasn't at all like conversation, she thought, as he never said anything to her; in fact, his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree so she stood and softly repeated to herself: 'humpty dumpty sat on a wall: humpty dumpty had a great fall. all the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put humpty dumpty in his place again.' 'that last line is much too long for the poetry,' she added, almost out loud, forgetting that humpty dumpty would hear her. 'don't stand there chattering to yourself like that,' humpty dumpty said, looking at her for the first time, 'but tell me your name and your business.' 'my name is alice, but ' 'it's a stupid enough name ' humpty dumpty interrupted impatiently. 'what does it mean ' 'must a name mean something ' alice asked doubtfully. 'of course it must,' humpty dumpty said with a short laugh: 'my name means the shape i am and a good handsome shape it is, too. with a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.' 'why do you sit out here all alone ' said alice, not wishing to begin an argument. 'why, because there's nobody with me ' cried humpty dumpty. 'did you think i didn't know the answer to that ask another.' 'don't you think you'd be safer down on the ground ' alice went on, not with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured anxiety for the queer creature. 'that wall is so very narrow ' 'what tremendously easy riddles you ask ' humpty dumpty growled out. 'of course i don't think so why, if ever i did fall off which there's no chance of but if i did ' here he pursed up his lips and looked so solemn and grand that alice could hardly help laughing. 'if i did fall,' he went on, 'the king has promised me ah, you may turn pale, if you like you didn't think i was going to say that, did you the king has promised me with his very own mouth to to ' 'to send all his horses and all his men,' alice interrupted, rather unwisely. 'now i declare that's too bad ' humpty dumpty cried, breaking into a sudden passion. 'you've been listening at doors and behind trees and down chimneys or you couldn't have known it ' 'i haven't, indeed ' alice said very gently. 'it's in a book.' 'ah, well they may write such things in a book,' humpty dumpty said in a calmer tone. 'that's what you call a history of england, that is. now, take a good look at me i'm one that has spoken to a king, i am: mayhap you'll never see such another: and to show you i'm not proud, you may shake hands with me ' and he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so) and offered alice his hand. she watched him a little anxiously as she took it. 'if he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet behind,' she thought: 'and then i don't know what would happen to his head i'm afraid it would come off ' 'yes, all his horses and all his men,' humpty dumpty went on. 'they'd pick me up again in a minute, they would however, this conversation is going on a little too fast: let's go back to the last remark but one.' 'i'm afraid i can't quite remember it,' alice said very politely. 'in that case we start fresh,' said humpty dumpty, 'and it's my turn to choose a subject ' ('he talks about it just as if it was a game ' thought alice.) 'so here's a question for you. how old did you say you were ' alice made a short calculation, and said 'seven years and six months.' 'wrong ' humpty dumpty exclaimed triumphantly. 'you never said a word like it ' 'i though you meant 'how old are you '' alice explained. 'if i'd meant that, i'd have said it,' said humpty dumpty. alice didn't want to begin another argument, so she said nothing. 'seven years and six months ' humpty dumpty repeated thoughtfully. 'an uncomfortable sort of age. now if you'd asked my advice, i'd have said 'leave off at seven' but it's too late now.' 'i never ask advice about growing,' alice said indignantly. 'too proud ' the other inquired. alice felt even more indignant at this suggestion. 'i mean,' she said, 'that one can't help growing older.' 'one can't, perhaps,' said humpty dumpty, 'but two can. with proper assistance, you might have left off at seven.' 'what a beautiful belt you've got on ' alice suddenly remarked. (they had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn now.) 'at least,' she corrected herself on second thoughts, 'a beautiful cravat, i should have said no, a belt, i mean i beg your pardon ' she added in dismay, for humpty dumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she began to wish she hadn't chosen that subject. 'if i only knew,' she thought to herself, 'which was neck and which was waist ' evidently humpty dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a minute or two. when he did speak again, it was in a deep growl. 'it is a most provoking thing,' he said at last, 'when a person doesn't know a cravat from a belt ' 'i know it's very ignorant of me,' alice said, in so humble a tone that humpty dumpty relented. 'it's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. it's a present from the white king and queen. there now ' 'is it really ' said alice, quite pleased to find that she had chosen a good subject, after all. 'they gave it me,' humpty dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, 'they gave it me for an un-birthday present.' 'i beg your pardon ' alice said with a puzzled air. 'i'm not offended,' said humpty dumpty. 'i mean, what is an un-birthday present ' 'a present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.' alice considered a little. 'i like birthday presents best,' she said at last. 'you don't know what you're talking about ' cried humpty dumpty. 'how many days are there in a year ' 'three hundred and sixty-five,' said alice. 'and how many birthdays have you ' 'one.' 'and if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what remains ' 'three hundred and sixty-four, of course.' humpty dumpty looked doubtful. 'i'd rather see that done on paper,' he said. alice couldn't help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and worked the sum for him: humpty dumpty took the book, and looked at it carefully. 'that seems to be done right ' he began. 'you're holding it upside down ' alice interrupted. 'to be sure i was ' humpty dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round for him. 'i thought it looked a little queer. as i was saying, that seems to be done right though i haven't time to look it over thoroughly just now and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents ' 'certainly,' said alice. 'and only one for birthday presents, you know. there's glory for you ' 'i don't know what you mean by 'glory,'' alice said. humpty dumpty smiled contemptuously. 'of course you don't till i tell you. i meant 'there's a nice knock-down argument for you '' 'but 'glory' doesn't mean 'a nice knock-down argument,'' alice objected. 'when i use a word,' humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, 'it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less.' 'the question is,' said alice, 'whether you can make words mean so many different things.' 'the question is,' said humpty dumpty, 'which is to be master that's all.' alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute humpty dumpty began again. 'they've a temper, some of them particularly verbs, they're the proudest adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs however, i can manage the whole lot of them impenetrability that's what i say ' 'would you tell me, please,' said alice 'what that means ' 'now you talk like a reasonable child,' said humpty dumpty, looking very much pleased. 'i meant by 'impenetrability' that we've had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you mean to do next, as i suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.' 'that's a great deal to make one word mean,' alice said in a thoughtful tone. 'when i make a word do a lot of work like that,' said humpty dumpty, 'i always pay it extra.' 'oh ' said alice. she was too much puzzled to make any other remark. 'ah, you should see 'em come round me of a saturday night,' humpty dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: 'for to get their wages, you know.' (alice didn't venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see i can't tell you.) 'you seem very clever at explaining words, sir,' said alice. 'would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called 'jabberwocky' ' 'let's hear it,' said humpty dumpty. 'i can explain all the poems that were ever invented and a good many that haven't been invented just yet.' this sounded very hopeful, so alice repeated the first verse: 'twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe; all mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgrabe. 'that's enough to begin with,' humpty dumpty interrupted: 'there are plenty of hard words there. 'brillig' means four o'clock in the afternoon the time when you begin broiling things for dinner.' 'that'll do very well,' said alice: 'and 'slithy' ' 'well, 'slithy' means 'lithe and slimy.' 'lithe' is the same as 'active.' you see it's like a portmanteau there are two meanings packed up into one word.' 'i see it now,' alice remarked thoughtfully: 'and what are 'toves' ' 'well, 'toves' are something like badgers they're something like lizards and they're something like corkscrews.' 'they must be very curious looking creatures.' 'they are that,' said humpty dumpty: 'also they make their nests under sun-dials also they live on cheese.' 'and what's the 'gyre' and to 'gimble' ' 'to 'gyre' is to go round and round like a gyroscope. to 'gimble' is to make holes like a gimlet.' 'and 'the wabe' is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, i suppose ' said alice, surprised at her own ingenuity. 'of course it is. it's called 'wabe,' you know, because it goes a long way before it, and a long way behind it ' 'and a long way beyond it on each side,' alice added. 'exactly so. well, then, 'mimsy' is 'flimsy and miserable' (there's another portmanteau for you). and a 'borogove' is a thin shabby-looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round something like a live mop.' 'and then 'mome raths' ' said alice. 'i'm afraid i'm giving you a great deal of trouble.' 'well, a 'rath' is a sort of green pig: but 'mome' i'm not certain about. i think it's short for 'from home' meaning that they'd lost their way, you know.' 'and what does 'outgrabe' mean ' 'well, 'outgrabing' is something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you'll hear it done, maybe down in the wood yonder and when you've once heard it you'll be quite content. who's been repeating all that hard stuff to you ' 'i read it in a book,' said alice. 'but i had some poetry repeated to me, much easier than that, by tweedledee, i think it was.' 'as to poetry, you know,' said humpty dumpty, stretching out one of his great hands, ' i can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes to that ' 'oh, it needn't come to that ' alice hastily said, hoping to keep him from beginning. 'the piece i'm going to repeat,' he went on without noticing her remark, 'was written entirely for your amusement.' alice felt that in that case she really ought to listen to it, so she sat down, and said 'thank you' rather sadly. 'in winter, when the fields are white, i sing this song for your delight only i don't sing it,' he added, as an explanation. 'i see you don't,' said alice. 'if you can see whether i'm singing or not, you've sharper eyes than most.' humpty dumpty remarked severely. alice was silent. 'in spring, when woods are getting green, i'll try and tell you what i mean.' 'thank you very much,' said alice. 'in summer, when the days are long, perhaps you'll understand the song: in autumn, when the leaves are brown, take pen and ink, and write it down.' 'i will, if i can remember it so long,' said alice. 'you needn't go on making remarks like that,' humpty dumpty said: 'they're not sensible, and they put me out.' 'i sent a message to the fish: i told them 'this is what i wish.' the little fishes of the sea, they sent an answer back to me. the little fishes' answer was 'we cannot do it, sir, because '' 'i'm afraid i don't quite understand,' said alice. 'it gets easier further on,' humpty dumpty replied. 'i sent to them again to say 'it will be better to obey.' the fishes answered with a grin, 'why, what a temper you are in ' i told them once, i told them twice: they would not listen to advice. i took a kettle large and new, fit for the deed i had to do. my heart went hop, my heart went thump; i filled the kettle at the pump. then some one came to me and said, 'the little fishes are in bed.' i said to him, i said it plain, 'then you must wake them up again.' i said it very loud and clear; i went and shouted in his ear.' humpty dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this verse, and alice thought with a shudder, 'i wouldn't have been the messenger for anything ' 'but he was very stiff and proud; he said 'you needn't shout so loud ' and he was very proud and stiff; he said 'i'd go and wake them, if ' i took a corkscrew from the shelf: i went to wake them up myself. and when i found the door was locked, i pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked. and when i found the door was shut, i tried to turn the handle, but ' there was a long pause. 'is that all ' alice timidly asked. 'that's all,' said humpty dumpty. 'good-bye.' this was rather sudden, alice thought: but, after such a very strong hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil to stay. so she got up, and held out her hand. 'good-bye, till we meet again ' she said as cheerfully as she could. 'i shouldn't know you again if we did meet,' humpty dumpty replied in a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake; 'you're so exactly like other people.' 'the face is what one goes by, generally,' alice remarked in a thoughtful tone. 'that's just what i complain of,' said humpty dumpty. 'your face is the same as everybody has the two eyes, so ' (marking their places in the air with this thumb) 'nose in the middle, mouth under. it's always the same. now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for instance or the mouth at the top that would be some help.' 'it wouldn't look nice,' alice objected. but humpty dumpty only shut his eyes and said 'wait till you've tried.' alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said 'good-bye ' once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away: but she couldn't help saying to herself as she went, 'of all the unsatisfactory ' (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to have such a long word to say) 'of all the unsatisfactory people i ever met ' she never finished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash shook the forest from end to end. the next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in twos and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowds that they seemed to fill the whole forest. alice got behind a tree, for fear of being run over, and watched them go by. she thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or other, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him, so that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men. then came the horses. having four feet, these managed rather better than the foot-soldiers: but even they stumbled now and then; and it seemed to be a regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off instantly. the confusion got worse every moment, and alice was very glad to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found the white king seated on the ground, busily writing in his memorandum-book. 'i've sent them all ' the king cried in a tone of delight, on seeing alice. 'did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came through the wood ' 'yes, i did,' said alice: 'several thousand, i should think.' 'four thousand two hundred and seven, that's the exact number,' the king said, referring to his book. 'i couldn't send all the horses, you know, because two of them are wanted in the game. and i haven't sent the two messengers, either. they're both gone to the town. just look along the road, and tell me if you can see either of them.' 'i see nobody on the road,' said alice. 'i only wish i had such eyes,' the king remarked in a fretful tone. 'to be able to see nobody and at that distance, too why, it's as much as i can do to see real people, by this light ' all this was lost on alice, who was still looking intently along the road, shading her eyes with one hand. 'i see somebody now ' she exclaimed at last. 'but he's coming very slowly and what curious attitudes he goes into ' (for the messenger kept skipping up and down, and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spread out like fans on each side.) 'not at all,' said the king. 'he's an anglo-saxon messenger and those are anglo-saxon attitudes. he only does them when he's happy. his name is haigha.' (he pronounced it so as to rhyme with 'mayor.') 'i love my love with an h,' alice couldn't help beginning, 'because he is happy. i hate him with an h, because he is hideous. i fed him with with with ham-sandwiches and hay. his name is haigha, and he lives ' 'he lives on the hill,' the king remarked simply, without the least idea that he was joining in the game, while alice was still hesitating for the name of a town beginning with h. 'the other messenger's called hatta. i must have two, you know to come and go. one to come, and one to go.' 'i beg your pardon ' said alice. 'it isn't respectable to beg,' said the king. 'i only meant that i didn't understand,' said alice. 'why one to come and one to go ' 'didn't i tell you ' the king repeated impatiently. 'i must have two to fetch and carry. one to fetch, and one to carry.' at this moment the messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and make the most fearful faces at the poor king. 'this young lady loves you with an h,' the king said, introducing alice in the hope of turning off the messenger's attention from himself but it was no use the anglo-saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side. 'you alarm me ' said the king. 'i feel faint give me a ham sandwich ' on which the messenger, to alice's great amusement, opened a bag that hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the king, who devoured it greedily. 'another sandwich ' said the king. 'there's nothing but hay left now,' the messenger said, peeping into the bag. 'hay, then,' the king murmured in a faint whisper. alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. 'there's nothing like eating hay when you're faint,' he remarked to her, as he munched away. 'i should think throwing cold water over you would be better,' alice suggested: 'or some sal-volatile.' 'i didn't say there was nothing better,' the king replied. 'i said there was nothing like it.' which alice did not venture to deny. 'who did you pass on the road ' the king went on, holding out his hand to the messenger for some more hay. 'nobody,' said the messenger. 'quite right,' said the king: 'this young lady saw him too. so of course nobody walks slower than you.' 'i do my best,' the messenger said in a sulky tone. 'i'm sure nobody walks much faster than i do ' 'he can't do that,' said the king, 'or else he'd have been here first. however, now you've got your breath, you may tell us what's happened in the town.' 'i'll whisper it,' said the messenger, putting his hands to his mouth in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the king's ear. alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too. however, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his voice 'they're at it again ' 'do you call that a whisper ' cried the poor king, jumping up and shaking himself. 'if you do such a thing again, i'll have you buttered it went through and through my head like an earthquake ' 'it would have to be a very tiny earthquake ' thought alice. 'who are at it again ' she ventured to ask. 'why the lion and the unicorn, of course,' said the king. 'fighting for the crown ' 'yes, to be sure,' said the king: 'and the best of the joke is, that it's my crown all the while let's run and see them.' and they trotted off, alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the old song: 'the lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown: the lion beat the unicorn all round the town. some gave them white bread, some gave them brown; some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.' 'does the one that wins get the crown ' she asked, as well as she could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath. 'dear me, no ' said the king. 'what an idea ' 'would you be good enough,' alice panted out, after running a little further, 'to stop a minute just to get one's breath again ' 'i'm good enough,' the king said, 'only i'm not strong enough. you see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick. you might as well try to stop a bandersnatch ' alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence, till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the lion and unicorn were fighting. they were in such a cloud of dust, that at first alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed to distinguish the unicorn by his horn. they placed themselves close to where hatta, the other messenger, was standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'he's only just out of prison, and he hadn't finished his tea when he was sent in,' haigha whispered to alice: 'and they only give them oyster-shells in there so you see he's very hungry and thirsty. how are you, dear child ' he went on, putting his arm affectionately round hatta's neck. hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter. 'were you happy in prison, dear child ' said haigha. hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down his cheek: but not a word would he say. 'speak, can't you ' haigha cried impatiently. but hatta only munched away, and drank some more tea. 'speak, won't you ' cried the king. 'how are they getting on with the fight ' hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of bread-and-butter. 'they're getting on very well,' he said in a choking voice: 'each of them has been down about eighty-seven times.' 'then i suppose they'll soon bring the white bread and the brown ' alice ventured to remark. 'it's waiting for 'em now,' said hatta: 'this is a bit of it as i'm eating.' there was a pause in the fight just then, and the lion and the unicorn sat down, panting, while the king called out 'ten minutes allowed for refreshments ' haigha and hatta set to work at once, carrying rough trays of white and brown bread. alice took a piece to taste, but it was very dry. 'i don't think they'll fight any more to-day,' the king said to hatta: 'go and order the drums to begin.' and hatta went bounding away like a grasshopper. for a minute or two alice stood silent, watching him. suddenly she brightened up. 'look, look ' she cried, pointing eagerly. 'there's the white queen running across the country she came flying out of the wood over yonder how fast those queens can run ' 'there's some enemy after her, no doubt,' the king said, without even looking round. 'that wood's full of them.' 'but aren't you going to run and help her ' alice asked, very much surprised at his taking it so quietly. 'no use, no use ' said the king. 'she runs so fearfully quick. you might as well try to catch a bandersnatch but i'll make a memorandum about her, if you like she's a dear good creature,' he repeated softly to himself, as he opened his memorandum-book. 'do you spell 'creature' with a double 'e' ' at this moment the unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his pockets. 'i had the best of it this time ' he said to the king, just glancing at him as he passed. 'a little a little,' the king replied, rather nervously. 'you shouldn't have run him through with your horn, you know.' 'it didn't hurt him,' the unicorn said carelessly, and he was going on, when his eye happened to fall upon alice: he turned round rather instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the deepest disgust. 'what is this ' he said at last. 'this is a child ' haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of alice to introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an anglo-saxon attitude. 'we only found it to-day. it's as large as life, and twice as natural ' 'i always thought they were fabulous monsters ' said the unicorn. 'is it alive ' 'it can talk,' said haigha, solemnly. the unicorn looked dreamily at alice, and said 'talk, child.' alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: 'do you know, i always thought unicorns were fabulous monsters, too i never saw one alive before ' 'well, now that we have seen each other,' said the unicorn, 'if you'll believe in me, i'll believe in you. is that a bargain ' 'yes, if you like,' said alice. 'come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man ' the unicorn went on, turning from her to the king. 'none of your brown bread for me ' 'certainly certainly ' the king muttered, and beckoned to haigha. 'open the bag ' he whispered. 'quick not that one that's full of hay ' haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to alice to hold, while he got out a dish and carving-knife. how they all came out of it alice couldn't guess. it was just like a conjuring-trick, she thought. the lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very tired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut. 'what's this ' he said, blinking lazily at alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that sounded like the tolling of a great bell. 'ah, what is it, now ' the unicorn cried eagerly. 'you'll never guess i couldn't.' the lion looked at alice wearily. 'are you animal vegetable or mineral ' he said, yawning at every other word. 'it's a fabulous monster ' the unicorn cried out, before alice could reply. 'then hand round the plum-cake, monster,' the lion said, lying down and putting his chin on his paws. 'and sit down, both of you,' (to the king and the unicorn): 'fair play with the cake, you know ' the king was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between the two great creatures; but there was no other place for him. 'what a fight we might have for the crown, now ' the unicorn said, looking slyly up at the crown, which the poor king was nearly shaking off his head, he trembled so much. 'i should win easy,' said the lion. 'i'm not so sure of that,' said the unicorn. 'why, i beat you all round the town, you chicken ' the lion replied angrily, half getting up as he spoke. here the king interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very nervous, and his voice quite quivered. 'all round the town ' he said. 'that's a good long way. did you go by the old bridge, or the market-place you get the best view by the old bridge.' 'i'm sure i don't know,' the lion growled out as he lay down again. 'there was too much dust to see anything. what a time the monster is, cutting up that cake ' alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife. 'it's very provoking ' she said, in reply to the lion (she was getting quite used to being called 'the monster'). 'i've cut several slices already, but they always join on again ' 'you don't know how to manage looking-glass cakes,' the unicorn remarked. 'hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.' this sounded nonsense, but alice very obediently got up, and carried the dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so. 'now cut it up,' said the lion, as she returned to her place with the empty dish. 'i say, this isn't fair ' cried the unicorn, as alice sat with the knife in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin. 'the monster has given the lion twice as much as me ' 'she's kept none for herself, anyhow,' said the lion. 'do you like plum-cake, monster ' but before alice could answer him, the drums began. where the noise came from, she couldn't make out: the air seemed full of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite deafened. she started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in her terror, and had just time to see the lion and the unicorn rise to their feet, with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she dropped to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to shut out the dreadful uproar. 'if that doesn't 'drum them out of town,'' she thought to herself, 'nothing ever will ' after a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead silence, and alice lifted up her head in some alarm. there was no one to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming about the lion and the unicorn and those queer anglo-saxon messengers. however, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she had tried to cut the plum-cake, 'so i wasn't dreaming, after all,' she said to herself, 'unless unless we're all part of the same dream. only i do hope it's my dream, and not the red king's i don't like belonging to another person's dream,' she went on in a rather complaining tone: 'i've a great mind to go and wake him, and see what happens ' at this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of 'ahoy ahoy check ' and a knight dressed in crimson armour came galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club. just as he reached her, the horse stopped suddenly: 'you're my prisoner ' the knight cried, as he tumbled off his horse. startled as she was, alice was more frightened for him than for herself at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again. as soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more 'you're my ' but here another voice broke in 'ahoy ahoy check ' and alice looked round in some surprise for the new enemy. this time it was a white knight. he drew up at alice's side, and tumbled off his horse just as the red knight had done: then he got on again, and the two knights sat and looked at each other for some time without speaking. alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment. 'she's my prisoner, you know ' the red knight said at last. 'yes, but then i came and rescued her ' the white knight replied. 'well, we must fight for her, then,' said the red knight, as he took up his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something the shape of a horse's head), and put it on. 'you will observe the rules of battle, of course ' the white knight remarked, putting on his helmet too. 'i always do,' said the red knight, and they began banging away at each other with such fury that alice got behind a tree to be out of the way of the blows. 'i wonder, now, what the rules of battle are,' she said to herself, as she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: 'one rule seems to be, that if one knight hits the other, he knocks him off his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself and another rule seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were punch and judy what a noise they make when they tumble just like a whole set of fire-irons falling into the fender and how quiet the horses are they let them get on and off them just as if they were tables ' another rule of battle, that alice had not noticed, seemed to be that they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they shook hands, and then the red knight mounted and galloped off. 'it was a glorious victory, wasn't it ' said the white knight, as he came up panting. 'i don't know,' alice said doubtfully. 'i don't want to be anybody's prisoner. i want to be a queen.' 'so you will, when you've crossed the next brook,' said the white knight. 'i'll see you safe to the end of the wood and then i must go back, you know. that's the end of my move.' 'thank you very much,' said alice. 'may i help you off with your helmet ' it was evidently more than he could manage by himself; however, she managed to shake him out of it at last. 'now one can breathe more easily,' said the knight, putting back his shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face and large mild eyes to alice. she thought she had never seen such a strange-looking soldier in all her life. he was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder, upside-down, and with the lid hanging open. alice looked at it with great curiosity. 'i see you're admiring my little box.' the knight said in a friendly tone. 'it's my own invention to keep clothes and sandwiches in. you see i carry it upside-down, so that the rain can't get in.' 'but the things can get out,' alice gently remarked. 'do you know the lid's open ' 'i didn't know it,' the knight said, a shade of vexation passing over his face. 'then all the things must have fallen out and the box is no use without them.' he unfastened it as he spoke, and was just going to throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him, and he hung it carefully on a tree. 'can you guess why i did that ' he said to alice. alice shook her head. 'in hopes some bees may make a nest in it then i should get the honey.' 'but you've got a bee-hive or something like one fastened to the saddle,' said alice. 'yes, it's a very good bee-hive,' the knight said in a discontented tone, 'one of the best kind. but not a single bee has come near it yet. and the other thing is a mouse-trap. i suppose the mice keep the bees out or the bees keep the mice out, i don't know which.' 'i was wondering what the mouse-trap was for,' said alice. 'it isn't very likely there would be any mice on the horse's back.' 'not very likely, perhaps,' said the knight: 'but if they do come, i don't choose to have them running all about.' 'you see,' he went on after a pause, 'it's as well to be provided for everything. that's the reason the horse has all those anklets round his feet.' 'but what are they for ' alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. 'to guard against the bites of sharks,' the knight replied. 'it's an invention of my own. and now help me on. i'll go with you to the end of the wood what's the dish for ' 'it's meant for plum-cake,' said alice. 'we'd better take it with us,' the knight said. 'it'll come in handy if we find any plum-cake. help me to get it into this bag.' this took a very long time to manage, though alice held the bag open very carefully, because the knight was so very awkward in putting in the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself instead. 'it's rather a tight fit, you see,' he said, as they got it in a last; 'there are so many candlesticks in the bag.' and he hung it to the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and fire-irons, and many other things. 'i hope you've got your hair well fastened on ' he continued, as they set off. 'only in the usual way,' alice said, smiling. 'that's hardly enough,' he said, anxiously. 'you see the wind is so very strong here. it's as strong as soup.' 'have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off ' alice enquired. 'not yet,' said the knight. 'but i've got a plan for keeping it from falling off.' 'i should like to hear it, very much.' 'first you take an upright stick,' said the knight. 'then you make your hair creep up it, like a fruit-tree. now the reason hair falls off is because it hangs down things never fall upwards, you know. it's a plan of my own invention. you may try it if you like.' it didn't sound a comfortable plan, alice thought, and for a few minutes she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and every now and then stopping to help the poor knight, who certainly was not a good rider. whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather suddenly), he fell off behind. otherwise he kept on pretty well, except that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he generally did this on the side on which alice was walking, she soon found that it was the best plan not to walk quite close to the horse. 'i'm afraid you've not had much practice in riding,' she ventured to say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble. the knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the remark. 'what makes you say that ' he asked, as he scrambled back into the saddle, keeping hold of alice's hair with one hand, to save himself from falling over on the other side. 'because people don't fall off quite so often, when they've had much practice.' 'i've had plenty of practice,' the knight said very gravely: 'plenty of practice ' alice could think of nothing better to say than 'indeed ' but she said it as heartily as she could. they went on a little way in silence after this, the knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and alice watching anxiously for the next tumble. 'the great art of riding,' the knight suddenly began in a loud voice, waving his right arm as he spoke, 'is to keep ' here the sentence ended as suddenly as it had begun, as the knight fell heavily on the top of his head exactly in the path where alice was walking. she was quite frightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him up, 'i hope no bones are broken ' 'none to speak of,' the knight said, as if he didn't mind breaking two or three of them. 'the great art of riding, as i was saying, is to keep your balance properly. like this, you know ' he let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show alice what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the horse's feet. 'plenty of practice ' he went on repeating, all the time that alice was getting him on his feet again. 'plenty of practice ' 'it's too ridiculous ' cried alice, losing all her patience this time. 'you ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought ' 'does that kind go smoothly ' the knight asked in a tone of great interest, clasping his arms round the horse's neck as he spoke, just in time to save himself from tumbling off again. 'much more smoothly than a live horse,' alice said, with a little scream of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it. 'i'll get one,' the knight said thoughtfully to himself. 'one or two several.' there was a short silence after this, and then the knight went on again. 'i'm a great hand at inventing things. now, i daresay you noticed, that last time you picked me up, that i was looking rather thoughtful ' 'you were a little grave,' said alice. 'well, just then i was inventing a new way of getting over a gate would you like to hear it ' 'very much indeed,' alice said politely. 'i'll tell you how i came to think of it,' said the knight. 'you see, i said to myself, 'the only difficulty is with the feet: the head is high enough already.' now, first i put my head on the top of the gate then i stand on my head then the feet are high enough, you see then i'm over, you see.' 'yes, i suppose you'd be over when that was done,' alice said thoughtfully: 'but don't you think it would be rather hard ' 'i haven't tried it yet,' the knight said, gravely: 'so i can't tell for certain but i'm afraid it would be a little hard.' he looked so vexed at the idea, that alice changed the subject hastily. 'what a curious helmet you've got ' she said cheerfully. 'is that your invention too ' the knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the saddle. 'yes,' he said, 'but i've invented a better one than that like a sugar loaf. when i used to wear it, if i fell off the horse, it always touched the ground directly. so i had a very little way to fall, you see but there was the danger of falling into it, to be sure. that happened to me once and the worst of it was, before i could get out again, the other white knight came and put it on. he thought it was his own helmet.' the knight looked so solemn about it that alice did not dare to laugh. 'i'm afraid you must have hurt him,' she said in a trembling voice, 'being on the top of his head.' 'i had to kick him, of course,' the knight said, very seriously. 'and then he took the helmet off again but it took hours and hours to get me out. i was as fast as as lightning, you know.' 'but that's a different kind of fastness,' alice objected. the knight shook his head. 'it was all kinds of fastness with me, i can assure you ' he said. he raised his hands in some excitement as he said this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a deep ditch. alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. she was rather startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and she was afraid that he really was hurt this time. however, though she could see nothing but the soles of his feet, she was much relieved to hear that he was talking on in his usual tone. 'all kinds of fastness,' he repeated: 'but it was careless of him to put another man's helmet on with the man in it, too.' 'how can you go on talking so quietly, head downwards ' alice asked, as she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the bank. the knight looked surprised at the question. 'what does it matter where my body happens to be ' he said. 'my mind goes on working all the same. in fact, the more head downwards i am, the more i keep inventing new things.' 'now the cleverest thing of the sort that i ever did,' he went on after a pause, 'was inventing a new pudding during the meat-course.' 'in time to have it cooked for the next course ' said alice. 'well, not the next course,' the knight said in a slow thoughtful tone: 'no, certainly not the next course.' 'then it would have to be the next day. i suppose you wouldn't have two pudding-courses in one dinner ' 'well, not the next day,' the knight repeated as before: 'not the next day. in fact,' he went on, holding his head down, and his voice getting lower and lower, 'i don't believe that pudding ever was cooked in fact, i don't believe that pudding ever will be cooked and yet it was a very clever pudding to invent.' 'what did you mean it to be made of ' alice asked, hoping to cheer him up, for the poor knight seemed quite low-spirited about it. 'it began with blotting paper,' the knight answered with a groan. 'that wouldn't be very nice, i'm afraid ' 'not very nice alone,' he interrupted, quite eagerly: 'but you've no idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other things such as gunpowder and sealing-wax. and here i must leave you.' they had just come to the end of the wood. alice could only look puzzled: she was thinking of the pudding. 'you are sad,' the knight said in an anxious tone: 'let me sing you a song to comfort you.' 'is it very long ' alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry that day. 'it's long,' said the knight, 'but very, very beautiful. everybody that hears me sing it either it brings the tears into their eyes, or else ' 'or else what ' said alice, for the knight had made a sudden pause. 'or else it doesn't, you know. the name of the song is called 'haddocks' eyes.'' 'oh, that's the name of the song, is it ' alice said, trying to feel interested. 'no, you don't understand,' the knight said, looking a little vexed. 'that's what the name is called. the name really is 'the aged aged man.'' 'then i ought to have said 'that's what the song is called' ' alice corrected herself. 'no, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing the song is called 'ways and means': but that's only what it's called, you know ' 'well, what is the song, then ' said alice, who was by this time completely bewildered. 'i was coming to that,' the knight said. 'the song really is 'a-sitting on a gate': and the tune's my own invention.' so saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck: then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile lighting up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his song, he began. of all the strange things that alice saw in her journey through the looking-glass, this was the one that she always remembered most clearly. years afterwards she could bring the whole scene back again, as if it had been only yesterday the mild blue eyes and kindly smile of the knight the setting sun gleaming through his hair, and shining on his armour in a blaze of light that quite dazzled her the horse quietly moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping the grass at her feet and the black shadows of the forest behind all this she took in like a picture, as, with one hand shading her eyes, she leant against a tree, watching the strange pair, and listening, in a half dream, to the melancholy music of the song. 'but the tune isn't his own invention,' she said to herself: 'it's 'i give thee all, i can no more.'' she stood and listened very attentively, but no tears came into her eyes. 'i'll tell thee everything i can; there's little to relate. i saw an aged aged man, a-sitting on a gate. 'who are you, aged man ' i said, 'and how is it you live ' and his answer trickled through my head like water through a sieve. he said 'i look for butterflies that sleep among the wheat: i make them into mutton-pies, and sell them in the street. i sell them unto men,' he said, 'who sail on stormy seas; and that's the way i get my bread a trifle, if you please.' but i was thinking of a plan to dye one's whiskers green, and always use so large a fan that they could not be seen. so, having no reply to give to what the old man said, i cried, 'come, tell me how you live ' and thumped him on the head. his accents mild took up the tale: he said 'i go my ways, and when i find a mountain-rill, i set it in a blaze; and thence they make a stuff they call rolands' macassar oil yet twopence-halfpenny is all they give me for my toil.' but i was thinking of a way to feed oneself on batter, and so go on from day to day getting a little fatter. i shook him well from side to side, until his face was blue: 'come, tell me how you live,' i cried, 'and what it is you do ' he said 'i hunt for haddocks' eyes among the heather bright, and work them into waistcoat-buttons in the silent night. and these i do not sell for gold or coin of silvery shine but for a copper halfpenny, and that will purchase nine. 'i sometimes dig for buttered rolls, or set limed twigs for crabs; i sometimes search the grassy knolls for wheels of hansom-cabs. and that's the way' (he gave a wink) 'by which i get my wealth and very gladly will i drink your honour's noble health.' i heard him then, for i had just completed my design to keep the menai bridge from rust by boiling it in wine. i thanked him much for telling me the way he got his wealth, but chiefly for his wish that he might drink my noble health. and now, if e'er by chance i put my fingers into glue or madly squeeze a right-hand foot into a left-hand shoe, or if i drop upon my toe a very heavy weight, i weep, for it reminds me so, of that old man i used to know whose look was mild, whose speech was slow, whose hair was whiter than the snow, whose face was very like a crow, with eyes, like cinders, all aglow, who seemed distracted with his woe, who rocked his body to and fro, and muttered mumblingly and low, as if his mouth were full of dough, who snorted like a buffalo that summer evening, long ago, a-sitting on a gate.' as the knight sang the last words of the ballad, he gathered up the reins, and turned his horse's head along the road by which they had come. 'you've only a few yards to go,' he said, 'down the hill and over that little brook, and then you'll be a queen but you'll stay and see me off first ' he added as alice turned with an eager look in the direction to which he pointed. 'i shan't be long. you'll wait and wave your handkerchief when i get to that turn in the road i think it'll encourage me, you see.' 'of course i'll wait,' said alice: 'and thank you very much for coming so far and for the song i liked it very much.' 'i hope so,' the knight said doubtfully: 'but you didn't cry so much as i thought you would.' so they shook hands, and then the knight rode slowly away into the forest. 'it won't take long to see him off, i expect,' alice said to herself, as she stood watching him. 'there he goes right on his head as usual however, he gets on again pretty easily that comes of having so many things hung round the horse ' so she went on talking to herself, as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other. after the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her handkerchief to him, and waited till he was out of sight. 'i hope it encouraged him,' she said, as she turned to run down the hill: 'and now for the last brook, and to be a queen how grand it sounds ' a very few steps brought her to the edge of the brook. 'the eighth square at last ' she cried as she bounded across, and threw herself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss, with little flower-beds dotted about it here and there. 'oh, how glad i am to get here and what is this on my head ' she exclaimed in a tone of dismay, as she put her hands up to something very heavy, and fitted tight all round her head. 'but how can it have got there without my knowing it ' she said to herself, as she lifted it off, and set it on her lap to make out what it could possibly be. it was a golden crown. chapter ix. queen alice 'well, this is grand ' said alice. 'i never expected i should be a queen so soon and i'll tell you what it is, your majesty,' she went on in a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself), 'it'll never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that queens have to be dignified, you know ' so she got up and walked about rather stiffly just at first, as she was afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the thought that there was nobody to see her, 'and if i really am a queen,' she said as she sat down again, 'i shall be able to manage it quite well in time.' everything was happening so oddly that she didn't feel a bit surprised at finding the red queen and the white queen sitting close to her, one on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. however, there would be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. 'please, would you tell me ' she began, looking timidly at the red queen. 'speak when you're spoken to ' the queen sharply interrupted her. 'but if everybody obeyed that rule,' said alice, who was always ready for a little argument, 'and if you only spoke when you were spoken to, and the other person always waited for you to begin, you see nobody would ever say anything, so that ' 'ridiculous ' cried the queen. 'why, don't you see, child ' here she broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenly changed the subject of the conversation. 'what do you mean by 'if you really are a queen' what right have you to call yourself so you can't be a queen, you know, till you've passed the proper examination. and the sooner we begin it, the better.' 'i only said 'if' ' poor alice pleaded in a piteous tone. the two queens looked at each other, and the red queen remarked, with a little shudder, 'she says she only said 'if' ' 'but she said a great deal more than that ' the white queen moaned, wringing her hands. 'oh, ever so much more than that ' 'so you did, you know,' the red queen said to alice. 'always speak the truth think before you speak and write it down afterwards.' 'i'm sure i didn't mean ' alice was beginning, but the red queen interrupted her impatiently. 'that's just what i complain of you should have meant what do you suppose is the use of child without any meaning even a joke should have some meaning and a child's more important than a joke, i hope. you couldn't deny that, even if you tried with both hands.' 'i don't deny things with my hands,' alice objected. 'nobody said you did,' said the red queen. 'i said you couldn't if you tried.' 'she's in that state of mind,' said the white queen, 'that she wants to deny something only she doesn't know what to deny ' 'a nasty, vicious temper,' the red queen remarked; and then there was an uncomfortable silence for a minute or two. the red queen broke the silence by saying to the white queen, 'i invite you to alice's dinner-party this afternoon.' the white queen smiled feebly, and said 'and i invite you.' 'i didn't know i was to have a party at all,' said alice; 'but if there is to be one, i think i ought to invite the guests.' 'we gave you the opportunity of doing it,' the red queen remarked: 'but i daresay you've not had many lessons in manners yet ' 'manners are not taught in lessons,' said alice. 'lessons teach you to do sums, and things of that sort.' 'and you do addition ' the white queen asked. 'what's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one ' 'i don't know,' said alice. 'i lost count.' 'she can't do addition,' the red queen interrupted. 'can you do subtraction take nine from eight.' 'nine from eight i can't, you know,' alice replied very readily: 'but ' 'she can't do subtraction,' said the white queen. 'can you do division divide a loaf by a knife what's the answer to that ' 'i suppose ' alice was beginning, but the red queen answered for her. 'bread-and-butter, of course. try another subtraction sum. take a bone from a dog: what remains ' alice considered. 'the bone wouldn't remain, of course, if i took it and the dog wouldn't remain; it would come to bite me and i'm sure i shouldn't remain ' 'then you think nothing would remain ' said the red queen. 'i think that's the answer.' 'wrong, as usual,' said the red queen: 'the dog's temper would remain.' 'but i don't see how ' 'why, look here ' the red queen cried. 'the dog would lose its temper, wouldn't it ' 'perhaps it would,' alice replied cautiously. 'then if the dog went away, its temper would remain ' the queen exclaimed triumphantly. alice said, as gravely as she could, 'they might go different ways.' but she couldn't help thinking to herself, 'what dreadful nonsense we are talking ' 'she can't do sums a bit ' the queens said together, with great emphasis. 'can you do sums ' alice said, turning suddenly on the white queen, for she didn't like being found fault with so much. the queen gasped and shut her eyes. 'i can do addition, if you give me time but i can't do subtraction, under any circumstances ' 'of course you know your a b c ' said the red queen. 'to be sure i do.' said alice. 'so do i,' the white queen whispered: 'we'll often say it over together, dear. and i'll tell you a secret i can read words of one letter isn't that grand however, don't be discouraged. you'll come to it in time.' here the red queen began again. 'can you answer useful questions ' she said. 'how is bread made ' 'i know that ' alice cried eagerly. 'you take some flour ' 'where do you pick the flower ' the white queen asked. 'in a garden, or in the hedges ' 'well, it isn't picked at all,' alice explained: 'it's ground ' 'how many acres of ground ' said the white queen. 'you mustn't leave out so many things.' 'fan her head ' the red queen anxiously interrupted. 'she'll be feverish after so much thinking.' so they set to work and fanned her with bunches of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew her hair about so. 'she's all right again now,' said the red queen. 'do you know languages what's the french for fiddle-de-dee ' 'fiddle-de-dee's not english,' alice replied gravely. 'who ever said it was ' said the red queen. alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. 'if you'll tell me what language 'fiddle-de-dee' is, i'll tell you the french for it ' she exclaimed triumphantly. but the red queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said 'queens never make bargains.' 'i wish queens never asked questions,' alice thought to herself. 'don't let us quarrel,' the white queen said in an anxious tone. 'what is the cause of lightning ' 'the cause of lightning,' alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite certain about this, 'is the thunder no, no ' she hastily corrected herself. 'i meant the other way.' 'it's too late to correct it,' said the red queen: 'when you've once said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.' 'which reminds me ' the white queen said, looking down and nervously clasping and unclasping her hands, 'we had such a thunderstorm last tuesday i mean one of the last set of tuesdays, you know.' alice was puzzled. 'in our country,' she remarked, 'there's only one day at a time.' the red queen said, 'that's a poor thin way of doing things. now here, we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights together for warmth, you know.' 'are five nights warmer than one night, then ' alice ventured to ask. 'five times as warm, of course.' 'but they should be five times as cold, by the same rule ' 'just so ' cried the red queen. 'five times as warm, and five times as cold just as i'm five times as rich as you are, and five times as clever ' alice sighed and gave it up. 'it's exactly like a riddle with no answer ' she thought. 'humpty dumpty saw it too,' the white queen went on in a low voice, more as if she were talking to herself. 'he came to the door with a corkscrew in his hand ' 'what did he want ' said the red queen. 'he said he would come in,' the white queen went on, 'because he was looking for a hippopotamus. now, as it happened, there wasn't such a thing in the house, that morning.' 'is there generally ' alice asked in an astonished tone. 'well, only on thursdays,' said the queen. 'i know what he came for,' said alice: 'he wanted to punish the fish, because ' here the white queen began again. 'it was such a thunderstorm, you can't think ' ('she never could, you know,' said the red queen.) 'and part of the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in and it went rolling round the room in great lumps and knocking over the tables and things till i was so frightened, i couldn't remember my own name ' alice thought to herself, 'i never should try to remember my name in the middle of an accident where would be the use of it ' but she did not say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor queen's feeling. 'your majesty must excuse her,' the red queen said to alice, taking one of the white queen's hands in her own, and gently stroking it: 'she means well, but she can't help saying foolish things, as a general rule.' the white queen looked timidly at alice, who felt she ought to say something kind, but really couldn't think of anything at the moment. 'she never was really well brought up,' the red queen went on: 'but it's amazing how good-tempered she is pat her on the head, and see how pleased she'll be ' but this was more than alice had courage to do. 'a little kindness and putting her hair in papers would do wonders with her ' the white queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on alice's shoulder. 'i am so sleepy ' she moaned. 'she's tired, poor thing ' said the red queen. 'smooth her hair lend her your nightcap and sing her a soothing lullaby.' 'i haven't got a nightcap with me,' said alice, as she tried to obey the first direction: 'and i don't know any soothing lullabies.' 'i must do it myself, then,' said the red queen, and she began: 'hush-a-by lady, in alice's lap till the feast's ready, we've time for a nap: when the feast's over, we'll go to the ball red queen, and white queen, and alice, and all 'and now you know the words,' she added, as she put her head down on alice's other shoulder, 'just sing it through to me. i'm getting sleepy, too.' in another moment both queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud. 'what am i to do ' exclaimed alice, looking about in great perplexity, as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down from her shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. 'i don't think it ever happened before, that any one had to take care of two queens asleep at once no, not in all the history of england it couldn't, you know, because there never was more than one queen at a time. do wake up, you heavy things ' she went on in an impatient tone; but there was no answer but a gentle snoring. the snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a tune: at last she could even make out the words, and she listened so eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly missed them. she was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words queen alice in large letters, and on each side of the arch there was a bell-handle; one was marked 'visitors' bell,' and the other 'servants' bell.' 'i'll wait till the song's over,' thought alice, 'and then i'll ring the which bell must i ring ' she went on, very much puzzled by the names. 'i'm not a visitor, and i'm not a servant. there ought to be one marked 'queen,' you know ' just then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a long beak put its head out for a moment and said 'no admittance till the week after next ' and shut the door again with a bang. alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards her: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on. 'what is it, now ' the frog said in a deep hoarse whisper. alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody. 'where's the servant whose business it is to answer the door ' she began angrily. 'which door ' said the frog. alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he spoke. 'this door, of course ' the frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute: then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying whether the paint would come off; then he looked at alice. 'to answer the door ' he said. 'what's it been asking of ' he was so hoarse that alice could scarcely hear him. 'i don't know what you mean,' she said. 'i talks english, doesn't i ' the frog went on. 'or are you deaf what did it ask you ' 'nothing ' alice said impatiently. 'i've been knocking at it ' 'shouldn't do that shouldn't do that ' the frog muttered. 'vexes it, you know.' then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his great feet. 'you let it alone,' he panted out, as he hobbled back to his tree, 'and it'll let you alone, you know.' at this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard singing: 'to the looking-glass world it was alice that said, 'i've a sceptre in hand, i've a crown on my head; let the looking-glass creatures, whatever they be, come and dine with the red queen, the white queen, and me.'' and hundreds of voices joined in the chorus: 'then fill up the glasses as quick as you can, and sprinkle the table with buttons and bran: put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea and welcome queen alice with thirty-times-three ' then followed a confused noise of cheering, and alice thought to herself, 'thirty times three makes ninety. i wonder if any one's counting ' in a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill voice sang another verse; ''o looking-glass creatures,' quoth alice, 'draw near 'tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear: 'tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea along with the red queen, the white queen, and me '' then came the chorus again: 'then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink, or anything else that is pleasant to drink: mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine and welcome queen alice with ninety-times-nine ' 'ninety times nine ' alice repeated in despair, 'oh, that'll never be done i'd better go in at once ' and there was a dead silence the moment she appeared. alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large hall, and noticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds: some were animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among them. 'i'm glad they've come without waiting to be asked,' she thought: 'i should never have known who were the right people to invite ' there were three chairs at the head of the table; the red and white queens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty. alice sat down in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing for some one to speak. at last the red queen began. 'you've missed the soup and fish,' she said. 'put on the joint ' and the waiters set a leg of mutton before alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve a joint before. 'you look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton,' said the red queen. 'alice mutton; mutton alice.' the leg of mutton got up in the dish and made a little bow to alice; and alice returned the bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused. 'may i give you a slice ' she said, taking up the knife and fork, and looking from one queen to the other. 'certainly not,' the red queen said, very decidedly: 'it isn't etiquette to cut any one you've been introduced to. remove the joint ' and the waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its place. 'i won't be introduced to the pudding, please,' alice said rather hastily, 'or we shall get no dinner at all. may i give you some ' but the red queen looked sulky, and growled 'pudding alice; alice pudding. remove the pudding ' and the waiters took it away so quickly that alice couldn't return its bow. however, she didn't see why the red queen should be the only one to give orders, so, as an experiment, she called out 'waiter bring back the pudding ' and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. it was so large that she couldn't help feeling a little shy with it, as she had been with the mutton; however, she conquered her shyness by a great effort and cut a slice and handed it to the red queen. 'what impertinence ' said the pudding. 'i wonder how you'd like it, if i were to cut a slice out of you, you creature ' it spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and alice hadn't a word to say in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp. 'make a remark,' said the red queen: 'it's ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the pudding ' 'do you know, i've had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to-day,' alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she opened her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her; 'and it's a very curious thing, i think every poem was about fishes in some way. do you know why they're so fond of fishes, all about here ' she spoke to the red queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark. 'as to fishes,' she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth close to alice's ear, 'her white majesty knows a lovely riddle all in poetry all about fishes. shall she repeat it ' 'her red majesty's very kind to mention it,' the white queen murmured into alice's other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. 'it would be such a treat may i ' 'please do,' alice said very politely. the white queen laughed with delight, and stroked alice's cheek. then she began: ''first, the fish must be caught.' that is easy: a baby, i think, could have caught it. 'next, the fish must be bought.' that is easy: a penny, i think, would have bought it. 'now cook me the fish ' that is easy, and will not take more than a minute. 'let it lie in a dish ' that is easy, because it already is in it. 'bring it here let me sup ' it is easy to set such a dish on the table. 'take the dish-cover up ' ah, that is so hard that i fear i'm unable for it holds it like glue holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle: which is easiest to do, un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle ' 'take a minute to think about it, and then guess,' said the red queen. 'meanwhile, we'll drink your health queen alice's health ' she screamed at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly, and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their faces others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off the edges of the table and three of them (who looked like kangaroos) scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up the gravy, 'just like pigs in a trough ' thought alice. 'you ought to return thanks in a neat speech,' the red queen said, frowning at alice as she spoke. 'we must support you, you know,' the white queen whispered, as alice got up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened. 'thank you very much,' she whispered in reply, 'but i can do quite well without.' 'that wouldn't be at all the thing,' the red queen said very decidedly: so alice tried to submit to it with a good grace. ('and they did push so ' she said afterwards, when she was telling her sister the history of the feast. 'you would have thought they wanted to squeeze me flat ') in fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she made her speech: the two queens pushed her so, one on each side, that they nearly lifted her up into the air: 'i rise to return thanks ' alice began: and she really did rise as she spoke, several inches; but she got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself down again. 'take care of yourself ' screamed the white queen, seizing alice's hair with both her hands. 'something's going to happen ' and then (as alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened in a moment. the candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. as to the bottles, they each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: 'and very like birds they look,' alice thought to herself, as well as she could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning. at this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see what was the matter with the white queen; but, instead of the queen, there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. 'here i am ' cried a voice from the soup tureen, and alice turned again, just in time to see the queen's broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup. there was not a moment to be lost. already several of the guests were lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table towards alice's chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of its way. 'i can't stand this any longer ' she cried as she jumped up and seized the table-cloth with both hands: one good pull, and plates, dishes, guests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor. 'and as for you,' she went on, turning fiercely upon the red queen, whom she considered as the cause of all the mischief but the queen was no longer at her side she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her. at any other time, alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was far too much excited to be surprised at anything now. 'as for you,' she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, 'i'll shake you into a kitten, that i will ' she took her off the table as she spoke, and shook her backwards and forwards with all her might. the red queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very small, and her eyes got large and green: and still, as alice went on shaking her, she kept on growing shorter and fatter and softer and rounder and and it really was a kitten, after all. 'your majesty shouldn't purr so loud,' alice said, rubbing her eyes, and addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity. 'you woke me out of oh such a nice dream and you've been along with me, kitty all through the looking-glass world. did you know it, dear ' it is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (alice had once made the remark) that, whatever you say to them, they always purr. 'if they would only purr for 'yes' and mew for 'no,' or any rule of that sort,' she had said, 'so that one could keep up a conversation but how can you talk with a person if they always say the same thing ' on this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess whether it meant 'yes' or 'no.' so alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the red queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put the kitten and the queen to look at each other. 'now, kitty ' she cried, clapping her hands triumphantly. 'confess that was what you turned into ' ('but it wouldn't look at it,' she said, when she was explaining the thing afterwards to her sister: 'it turned away its head, and pretended not to see it: but it looked a little ashamed of itself, so i think it must have been the red queen.') 'sit up a little more stiffly, dear ' alice cried with a merry laugh. 'and curtsey while you're thinking what to what to purr. it saves time, remember ' and she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, 'just in honour of having been a red queen.' 'snowdrop, my pet ' she went on, looking over her shoulder at the white kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, 'when will dinah have finished with your white majesty, i wonder that must be the reason you were so untidy in my dream dinah do you know that you're scrubbing a white queen really, it's most disrespectful of you 'and what did dinah turn to, i wonder ' she prattled on, as she settled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand, to watch the kittens. 'tell me, dinah, did you turn to humpty dumpty i think you did however, you'd better not mention it to your friends just yet, for i'm not sure. 'by the way, kitty, if only you'd been really with me in my dream, there was one thing you would have enjoyed i had such a quantity of poetry said to me, all about fishes to-morrow morning you shall have a real treat. all the time you're eating your breakfast, i'll repeat 'the walrus and the carpenter' to you; and then you can make believe it's oysters, dear 'now, kitty, let's consider who it was that dreamed it all. this is a serious question, my dear, and you should not go on licking your paw like that as if dinah hadn't washed you this morning you see, kitty, it must have been either me or the red king. he was part of my dream, of course but then i was part of his dream, too was it the red king, kitty you were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know oh, kitty, do help to settle it i'm sure your paw can wait ' but the provoking kitten only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn't heard the question. which do you think it was a boat beneath a sunny sky, lingering onward dreamily in an evening of july children three that nestle near, eager eye and willing ear, pleased a simple tale to hear long has paled that sunny sky: echoes fade and memories die. autumn frosts have slain july. still she haunts me, phantomwise, alice moving under skies never seen by waking eyes. children yet, the tale to hear, eager eye and willing ear, lovingly shall nestle near. in a wonderland they lie, dreaming as the days go by, dreaming as the summers die: ever drifting down the stream lingering in the golden gleam life, what is it but a dream if and the thing is wildly possible the charge of writing nonsense were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem, it would be based, i feel convinced, on the line (in p 'then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes.' in view of this painful possibility, i will not (as i might) appeal indignantly to my other writings as a proof that i am incapable of such a deed: i will not (as i might) point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it, or to its noble teachings in natural history i will take the more prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened. the bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used to have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished, and it more than once happened, when the time came for replacing it, that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to. they knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the bellman about it he would only refer to his naval code, and read out in pathetic tones admiralty instructions which none of them had ever been able to understand so it generally ended in its being fastened on, anyhow, across the rudder. the helmsman used to stand by with tears in his eyes; he knew it was all wrong, but alas ruleof the code, 'no one shall speak to the man at the helm,' had been completed by the bellman himself with the words 'and the man at the helm shall speak to no one.' so remonstrance was impossible, and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day. during these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards. as this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the jabberwock, let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me, how to pronounce 'slithy toves.' the 'i' in 'slithy' is long, as in 'writhe'; and 'toves' is pronounced so as to rhyme with 'groves.' again, the first 'o' in 'borogoves' is pronounced like the 'o' in 'borrow.' i have heard people try to give it the sound of the 'o' in 'worry'. such is human perversity. this also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in that poem. humpty-dumpty's theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all. for instance, take the two words 'fuming' and 'furious.' make up your mind that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will first. now open your mouth and speak. if your thoughts incline ever so little towards 'fuming,' you will say 'fuming-furious;' if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards 'furious,' you will say 'furious-fuming;' but if you have the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say 'frumious.' supposing that, when pistol uttered the well-known words 'under which king, bezonian speak or die ' justice shallow had felt certain that it was either william or richard, but had not been able to settle which, so that he could not possibly say either name before the other, can it be doubted that, rather than die, he would have gasped out 'rilchiam ' fit the first the landing 'just the place for a snark ' the bellman cried, as he landed his crew with care; supporting each man on the top of the tide by a finger entwined in his hair. 'just the place for a snark i have said it twice: that alone should encourage the crew. just the place for a snark i have said it thrice: what i tell you three times is true.' the crew was complete: it included a boots a maker of bonnets and hoods a barrister, brought to arrange their disputes and a broker, to value their goods. a billiard-marker, whose skill was immense, might perhaps have won more than his share but a banker, engaged at enormous expense, had the whole of their cash in his care. there was also a beaver, that paced on the deck, or would sit making lace in the bow: and had often (the bellman said) saved them from wreck, though none of the sailors knew how. there was one who was famed for the number of things he forgot when he entered the ship: his umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings, and the clothes he had bought for the trip. he had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed, with his name painted clearly on each: but, since he omitted to mention the fact, they were all left behind on the beach. the loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because he had seven coats on when he came, with three pairs of boots but the worst of it was, he had wholly forgotten his name. he would answer to 'hi ' or to any loud cry, such as 'fry me ' or 'fritter my wig ' to 'what-you-may-call-um ' or 'what-was-his-name ' but especially 'thing-um-a-jig ' while, for those who preferred a more forcible word, he had different names from these: his intimate friends called him 'candle-ends,' and his enemies 'toasted-cheese.' 'his form is ungainly his intellect small ' (so the bellman would often remark) 'but his courage is perfect and that, after all, is the thing that one needs with a snark.' he would joke with hyenas, returning their stare with an impudent wag of the head: and he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear, 'just to keep up its spirits,' he said. he came as a baker: but owned, when too late and it drove the poor bellman half-mad he could only bake bridecake for which, i may state, no materials were to be had. the last of the crew needs especial remark, though he looked an incredible dunce: he had just one idea but, that one being 'snark,' the good bellman engaged him at once. he came as a butcher: but gravely declared, when the ship had been sailing a week, he could only kill beavers. the bellman looked scared, and was almost too frightened to speak: but at length he explained, in a tremulous tone, there was only one beaver on board; and that was a tame one he had of his own, whose death would be deeply deplored. the beaver, who happened to hear the remark, protested, with tears in its eyes, that not even the rapture of hunting the snark could atone for that dismal surprise it strongly advised that the butcher should be conveyed in a separate ship: but the bellman declared that would never agree with the plans he had made for the trip: navigation was always a difficult art, though with only one ship and one bell: and he feared he must really decline, for his part, undertaking another as well. the beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure a second-hand dagger-proof coat so the baker advised it and next, to insure its life in some office of note: this the banker suggested, and offered for hire (on moderate terms), or for sale, two excellent policies, one against fire, and one against damage from hail. yet still, ever after that sorrowful day, whenever the butcher was by, the beaver kept looking the opposite way, and appeared unaccountably shy. fit the second the bellman's speech the bellman himself they all praised to the skies such a carriage, such ease and such grace such solemnity, too one could see he was wise, the moment one looked in his face he had bought a large map representing the sea, without the least vestige of land: and the crew were much pleased when they found it to be a map they could all understand. 'what's the good of mercator's north poles and equators, tropics, zones, and meridian lines ' so the bellman would cry: and the crew would reply 'they are merely conventional signs 'other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes but we've got our brave captain to thank:' (so the crew would protest) 'that he's bought us the best a perfect and absolute blank ' this was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out that the captain they trusted so well had only one notion for crossing the ocean, and that was to tingle his bell. he was thoughtful and grave but the orders he gave were enough to bewilder a crew. when he cried 'steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard ' what on earth was the helmsman to do then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes: a thing, as the bellman remarked, that frequently happens in tropical climes, when a vessel is, so to speak, 'snarked.' but the principal failing occurred in the sailing, and the bellman, perplexed and distressed, said he had hoped, at least, when the wind blew due east, that the ship would not travel due west but the danger was past they had landed at last, with their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags: yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view, which consisted of chasms and crags. the bellman perceived that their spirits were low, and repeated in musical tone some jokes he had kept for a season of woe but the crew would do nothing but groan. he served out some grog with a liberal hand, and bade them sit down on the beach: and they could not but own that their captain looked grand, as he stood and delivered his speech. 'friends, romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears ' (they were all of them fond of quotations: so they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers, while he served out additional rations). 'we have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks, (four weeks to the month you may mark), but never as yet 'tis your captain who speaks) have we caught the least glimpse of a snark 'we have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days, (seven days to the week i allow), but a snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze, we have never beheld till now 'come, listen, my men, while i tell you again the five unmistakable marks by which you may know, wheresoever you go, the warranted genuine snarks. 'let us take them in order. the first is the taste, which is meagre and hollow, but crisp: like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist, with a flavour of will-o'-the-wisp. 'its habit of getting up late you'll agree that it carries too far, when i say that it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea, and dines on the following day. 'the third is its slowness in taking a jest. should you happen to venture on one, it will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed: and it always looks grave at a pun. 'the fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines, which is constantly carries about, and believes that they add to the beauty of scenes a sentiment open to doubt. 'the fifth is ambition. it next will be right to describe each particular batch: distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite, and those that have whiskers, and scratch. 'for, although common snarks do no manner of harm, yet, i feel it my duty to say, some are boojums ' the bellman broke off in alarm, for the baker had fainted away. fit the third the baker's tale they roused him with muffins they roused him with ice they roused him with mustard and cress they roused him with jam and judicious advice they set him conundrums to guess. when at length he sat up and was able to speak, his sad story he offered to tell; and the bellman cried 'silence not even a shriek ' and excitedly tingled his bell. there was silence supreme not a shriek, not a scream, scarcely even a howl or a groan, as the man they called 'ho ' told his story of woe in an antediluvian tone. 'my father and mother were honest, though poor ' 'skip all that ' cried the bellman in haste. 'if it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a snark we have hardly a minute to waste ' 'i skip forty years,' said the baker, in tears, 'and proceed without further remark to the day when you took me aboard of your ship to help you in hunting the snark. 'a dear uncle of mine (after whom i was named) remarked, when i bade him farewell ' 'oh, skip your dear uncle ' the bellman exclaimed, as he angrily tingled his bell. 'he remarked to me then,' said that mildest of men, ''if your snark be a snark, that is right: fetch it home by all means you may serve it with greens, and it's handy for striking a light. ''you may seek it with thimbles and seek it with care; you may hunt it with forks and hope; you may threaten its life with a railway-share; you may charm it with smiles and soap '' ('that's exactly the method,' the bellman bold in a hasty parenthesis cried, 'that's exactly the way i have always been told that the capture of snarks should be tried ') ''but oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day, if your snark be a boojum for then you will softly and suddenly vanish away, and never be met with again ' 'it is this, it is this that oppresses my soul, when i think of my uncle's last words: and my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl brimming over with quivering curds 'it is this, it is this ' 'we have had that before ' the bellman indignantly said. and the baker replied 'let me say it once more. it is this, it is this that i dread 'i engage with the snark every night after dark in a dreamy delirious fight: i serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes, and i use it for striking a light: 'but if ever i meet with a boojum, that day, in a moment (of this i am sure), i shall softly and suddenly vanish away and the notion i cannot endure ' fit the fourth the hunting the bellman looked huffish, and wrinkled his brow. 'if only you'd spoken before it's excessively awkward to mention it now, with the snark, so to speak, at the door 'we should all of us grieve, as you well may believe, if you never were met with again but surely, my man, when the voyage began, you might have suggested it then 'it's excessively awkward to mention it now as i think i've already remarked.' and the man they called 'hi ' replied, with a sigh, 'i informed you the day we embarked. 'you may charge me with murder or want of sense (we are all of us weak at times): but the slightest approach to a false pretence was never among my crimes 'i said it in hebrew i said it in dutch i said it in german and greek: but i wholly forgot (and it vexes me much) that english is what you speak ' ''tis a pitiful tale,' said the bellman, whose face had grown longer at every word: 'but, now that you've stated the whole of your case, more debate would be simply absurd. 'the rest of my speech' (he explained to his men) 'you shall hear when i've leisure to speak it. but the snark is at hand, let me tell you again 'tis your glorious duty to seek it 'to seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care; to pursue it with forks and hope; to threaten its life with a railway-share; to charm it with smiles and soap 'for the snark's a peculiar creature, that won't be caught in a commonplace way. do all that you know, and try all that you don't: not a chance must be wasted to-day 'for england expects i forbear to proceed: 'tis a maxim tremendous, but trite: and you'd best be unpacking the things that you need to rig yourselves out for the fight.' then the banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed), and changed his loose silver for notes. the baker with care combed his whiskers and hair, and shook the dust out of his coats. the boots and the broker were sharpening a spade each working the grindstone in turn: but the beaver went on making lace, and displayed no interest in the concern: though the barrister tried to appeal to its pride, and vainly proceeded to cite a number of cases, in which making laces had been proved an infringement of right. the maker of bonnets ferociously planned a novel arrangement of bows: while the billiard-marker with quivering hand was chalking the tip of his nose. but the butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine, with yellow kid gloves and a ruff said he felt it exactly like going to dine, which the bellman declared was all 'stuff.' 'introduce me, now there's a good fellow,' he said, 'if we happen to meet it together ' and the bellman, sagaciously nodding his head, said 'that must depend on the weather.' the beaver went simply galumphing about, at seeing the butcher so shy: and even the baker, though stupid and stout, made an effort to wink with one eye. 'be a man ' said the bellman in wrath, as he heard the butcher beginning to sob. 'should we meet with a jubjub, that desperate bird, we shall need all our strength for the job ' fit the fifth the beaver's lesson they sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; they pursued it with forks and hope; they threatened its life with a railway-share; they charmed it with smiles and soap. then the butcher contrived an ingenious plan for making a separate sally; and had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man, a dismal and desolate valley. but the very same plan to the beaver occurred: it had chosen the very same place: yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word, the disgust that appeared in his face. each thought he was thinking of nothing but 'snark' and the glorious work of the day; and each tried to pretend that he did not remark that the other was going that way. but the valley grew narrow and narrower still, and the evening got darker and colder, till (merely from nervousness, not from goodwill) they marched along shoulder to shoulder. then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky, and they knew that some danger was near: the beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail, and even the butcher felt queer. he thought of his childhood, left far far behind that blissful and innocent state the sound so exactly recalled to his mind a pencil that squeaks on a slate ''tis the voice of the jubjub ' he suddenly cried. (this man, that they used to call 'dunce.') 'as the bellman would tell you,' he added with pride, 'i have uttered that sentiment once. ''tis the note of the jubjub keep count, i entreat; you will find i have told it you twice. 'tis the song of the jubjub the proof is complete, if only i've stated it thrice.' the beaver had counted with scrupulous care, attending to every word: but it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair, when the third repetition occurred. it felt that, in spite of all possible pains, it had somehow contrived to lose count, and the only thing now was to rack its poor brains by reckoning up the amount. 'two added to one if that could but be done,' it said, 'with one's fingers and thumbs ' recollecting with tears how, in earlier years, it had taken no pains with its sums. 'the thing can be done,' said the butcher, 'i think. the thing must be done, i am sure. the thing shall be done bring me paper and ink, the best there is time to procure.' the beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens, and ink in unfailing supplies: while strange creepy creatures came out of their dens, and watched them with wondering eyes. so engrossed was the butcher, he heeded them not, as he wrote with a pen in each hand, and explained all the while in a popular style which the beaver could well understand. 'taking three as the subject to reason about a convenient number to state we add seven, and ten, and then multiply out by one thousand diminished by eight. 'the result we proceed to divide, as you see, by nine hundred and ninety two: then subtract seventeen, and the answer must be exactly and perfectly true. 'the method employed i would gladly explain, while i have it so clear in my head, if i had but the time and you had but the brain but much yet remains to be said. 'in one moment i've seen what has hitherto been enveloped in absolute mystery, and without extra charge i will give you at large a lesson in natural history.' in his genial way he proceeded to say (forgetting all laws of propriety, and that giving instruction, without introduction, would have caused quite a thrill in society), 'as to temper the jubjub's a desperate bird, since it lives in perpetual passion: its taste in costume is entirely absurd it is ages ahead of the fashion: 'but it knows any friend it has met once before: it never will look at a bribe: and in charity-meetings it stands at the door, and collects though it does not subscribe. 'its' flavour when cooked is more exquisite far than mutton, or oysters, or eggs: (some think it keeps best in an ivory jar, and some, in mahogany kegs:) 'you boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue: you condense it with locusts and tape: still keeping one principal object in view to preserve its symmetrical shape.' the butcher would gladly have talked till next day, but he felt that the lesson must end, and he wept with delight in attempting to say he considered the beaver his friend. while the beaver confessed, with affectionate looks more eloquent even than tears, it had learned in ten minutes far more than all books would have taught it in seventy years. they returned hand-in-hand, and the bellman, unmanned (for a moment) with noble emotion, said 'this amply repays all the wearisome days we have spent on the billowy ocean ' such friends, as the beaver and butcher became, have seldom if ever been known; in winter or summer, 'twas always the same you could never meet either alone. and when quarrels arose as one frequently finds quarrels will, spite of every endeavour the song of the jubjub recurred to their minds, and cemented their friendship for ever fit the sixth the barrister's dream they sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; they pursued it with forks and hope; they threatened its life with a railway-share; they charmed it with smiles and soap. but the barrister, weary of proving in vain that the beaver's lace-making was wrong, fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain that his fancy had dwelt on so long. he dreamed that he stood in a shadowy court, where the snark, with a glass in its eye, dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig on the charge of deserting its sty. the witnesses proved, without error or flaw, that the sty was deserted when found: and the judge kept explaining the state of the law in a soft under-current of sound. the indictment had never been clearly expressed, and it seemed that the snark had begun, and had spoken three hours, before any one guessed what the pig was supposed to have done. the jury had each formed a different view (long before the indictment was read), and they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew one word that the others had said. 'you must know ' said the judge: but the snark exclaimed 'fudge ' that statute is obsolete quite let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends on an ancient manorial right. 'in the matter of treason the pig would appear to have aided, but scarcely abetted: while the charge of insolvency fails, it is clear, if you grant the plea 'never indebted.' 'the fact of desertion i will not dispute; but its guilt, as i trust, is removed (so far as related to the costs of this suit) by the alibi which has been proved. 'my poor client's fate now depends on your votes.' here the speaker sat down in his place, and directed the judge to refer to his notes and briefly to sum up the case. but the judge said he never had summed up before; so the snark undertook it instead, and summed it so well that it came to far more than the witnesses ever had said when the verdict was called for, the jury declined, as the word was so puzzling to spell; but they ventured to hope that the snark wouldn't mind undertaking that duty as well. so the snark found the verdict, although, as it owned, it was spent with the toils of the day: when it said the word 'guilty ' the jury all groaned, and some of them fainted away. then the snark pronounced sentence, the judge being quite too nervous to utter a word: when it rose to its feet, there was silence like night, and the fall of a pin might be heard. 'transportation for life' was the sentence it gave, 'and then to be fined forty pound.' the jury all cheered, though the judge said he feared that the phrase was not legally sound. but their wild exultation was suddenly checked when the jailer informed them, with tears, such a sentence would have not the slightest effect, as the pig had been dead for some years. the judge left the court, looking deeply disgusted: but the snark, though a little aghast, as the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted, went bellowing on to the last. thus the barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed to grow every moment more clear: till he woke to the knell of a furious bell, which the bellman rang close at his ear. fit the seventh the banker's fate they sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; they pursued it with forks and hope; they threatened its life with a railway-share; they charmed it with smiles and soap. and the banker, inspired with a courage so new it was matter for general remark, rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view in his zeal to discover the snark but while he was seeking with thimbles and care, a bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh and grabbed at the banker, who shrieked in despair, for he knew it was useless to fly. he offered large discount he offered a cheque (drawn 'to bearer') for seven-pounds-ten: but the bandersnatch merely extended its neck and grabbed at the banker again. without rest or pause while those frumious jaws went savagely snapping around he skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped, till fainting he fell to the ground. the bandersnatch fled as the others appeared led on by that fear-stricken yell: and the bellman remarked 'it is just as i feared ' and solemnly tolled on his bell. he was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace the least likeness to what he had been: while so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white a wonderful thing to be seen to the horror of all who were present that day. he uprose in full evening dress, and with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say what his tongue could no longer express. down he sank in a chair ran his hands through his hair and chanted in mimsiest tones words whose utter inanity proved his insanity, while he rattled a couple of bones. 'leave him here to his fate it is getting so late ' the bellman exclaimed in a fright. 'we have lost half the day. any further delay, and we sha'nt catch a snark before night ' fit the eighth the vanishing they sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care; they pursued it with forks and hope; they threatened its life with a railway-share; they charmed it with smiles and soap. they shuddered to think that the chase might fail, and the beaver, excited at last, went bounding along on the tip of its tail, for the daylight was nearly past. 'there is thingumbob shouting ' the bellman said, 'he is shouting like mad, only hark he is waving his hands, he is wagging his head, he has certainly found a snark ' they gazed in delight, while the butcher exclaimed 'he was always a desperate wag ' they beheld him their baker their hero unnamed on the top of a neighboring crag. erect and sublime, for one moment of time. in the next, that wild figure they saw (as if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm, while they waited and listened in awe. 'it's a snark ' was the sound that first came to their ears, and seemed almost too good to be true. then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers: then the ominous words 'it's a boo-' then, silence. some fancied they heard in the air a weary and wandering sigh then sounded like '-jum ' but the others declare it was only a breeze that went by. they hunted till darkness came on, but they found not a button, or feather, or mark, by which they could tell that they stood on the ground where the baker had met with the snark. in the midst of the word he was trying to say, in the midst of his laughter and glee, he had softly and suddenly vanished away - for the snark was a boojum, you see. the ruddy glow of sunset was already fading into the sombre shadows of night, when two travellers might have been observed swiftly at a pace of six miles in the hour descending the rugged side of a mountain; the younger bounding from crag to crag with the agility of a fawn, while his companion, whose aged limbs seemed ill at ease in the heavy chain armour habitually worn by tourists in that district, toiled on painfully at his side. as is always the case under such circumstances, the younger knight was the first to break the silence. a goodly pace, i trow he exclaimed. we sped not thus in the ascent goodly, indeed the other echoed with a groan. we clomb it but at three miles in the hour. and on the dead level our pace is the younger suggested; for he was weak in statistics, and left all such details to his aged companion. four miles in the hour, the other wearily replied. not an ounce more, he added, with that love of metaphor so common in old age, and not a farthing less 'twas three hours past high noon when we left our hostelry, the young man said, musingly. we shall scarce be back by supper-time. perchance mine host will roundly deny us all food he will chide our tardy return, was the grave reply, and such a rebuke will be meet. a brave conceit cried the other, with a merry laugh. and should we bid him bring us yet another course, i trow his answer will be tart we shall but get our deserts, sighed the elder knight, who had never seen a joke in his life, and was somewhat displeased at his companion's untimely levity. 'twill be nine of the clock, he added in an undertone, by the time we regain our hostelry. full many a mile shall we have plodded this day how many how many cried the eager youth, ever athirst for knowledge. the old man was silent. tell me, he answered, after a moment's thought, what time it was when we stood together on yonder peak. not exact to the minute he added hastily, reading a protest in the young man's face. an' thy guess be within one poor half-hour of the mark, 'tis all i ask of thy mother's son then will i tell thee, true to the last inch, how far we shall have trudged betwixt three and nine of the clock. a groan was the young man's only reply; while his convulsed features and the deep wrinkles that chased each other across his manly brow, revealed the abyss of arithmetical agony into which one chance question had plunged him. straight down the crooked lane, and all round the square. let's ask balbus about it, said hugh. all right, said lambert. he can guess it, said hugh. rather, said lambert. no more words were needed: the two brothers understood each other perfectly. balbus was waiting for them at the hotel: the journey down had tired him, he said: so his two pupils had been the round of the place, in search of lodgings, without the old tutor who had been their inseparable companion from their childhood. they had named him after the hero of their latin exercise-book, which overflowed with anecdotes of that versatile genius anecdotes whose vagueness in detail was more than compensated by their sensational brilliance. balbus has overcome all his enemies had been marked by their tutor, in the margin of the book, successful bravery. in this way he had tried to extract a moral from every anecdote about balbus sometimes one of warning, as in balbus had borrowed a healthy dragon, against which he had written rashness in speculation sometimes of encouragement, as in the words influence of sympathy in united action, which stood opposite to the anecdote balbus was assisting his mother-in-law to convince the dragon and sometimes it dwindled down to a single word, such as prudence, which was all he could extract from the touching record that balbus, having scorched the tail of the dragon, went away. his pupils liked the short morals best, as it left them more room for marginal illustrations, and in this instance they required all the space they could get to exhibit the rapidity of the hero's departure. their report of the state of things was discouraging. that most fashionable of watering-places, little mendip, was chockfull (as the boys expressed it) from end to end. but in one square they had seen no less than four cards, in different houses, all announcing in flaming capitals eligible apartments. so there's plenty of choice, after all, you see, said spokesman hugh in conclusion. that doesn't follow from the data, said balbus, as he rose from the easy chair, where he had been dozing over the little mendip gazette . they may be all single rooms. however, we may as well see them. i shall be glad to stretch my legs a bit. an unprejudiced bystander might have objected that the operation was needless, and that this long, lank creature would have been all the better with even shorter legs: but no such thought occurred to his loving pupils. one on each side, they did their best to keep up with his gigantic strides, while hugh repeated the sentence in their father's letter, just received from abroad, over which he and lambert had been puzzling. he says a friend of his, the governor of what was that name again, lambert (kgovjni, said lambert.) well, yes. the governor of what-you-may-call-it wants to give a very small dinner-party, and he means to ask his father's brother-in-law, his brother's father-in-law, his father-in-law's brother, and his brother-in-law's father: and we're to guess how many guests there will be. there was an anxious pause. how large did he say the pudding was to be balbus said at last. take its cubical contents, divide by the cubical contents of what each man can eat, and the quotient he didn't say anything about pudding, said hugh, and here's the square, as they turned a corner and came into sight of the eligible apartments. it is a square was balbus' first cry of delight, as he gazed around him. beautiful beau-ti-ful equilateral and rectangular the boys looked round with less enthusiasm. number nine is the first with a card, said prosaic lambert; but balbus would not so soon awake from his dream of beauty. see, boys he cried. twenty doors on a side what symmetry each side divided into twenty-one equal parts it's delicious shall i knock, or ring said hugh, looking in some perplexity at a square brass plate which bore the simple inscription ring also. both, said balbus. that's an ellipsis, my boy. did you never see an ellipsis before i couldn't hardly read it, said hugh, evasively. it's no good having an ellipsis, if they don't keep it clean. which there is one room, gentlemen, said the smiling landlady. and a sweet room too as snug a little back-room we will see it, said balbus gloomily, as they followed her in. i knew how it would be one room in each house no view, i suppose which indeed there is , gentlemen the landlady indignantly protested, as she drew up the blind, and indicated the back garden. cabbages, i perceive, said balbus. well, they're green, at any rate. which the greens at the shops, their hostess explained, are by no means dependable upon. here you has them on the premises, and of the best. does the window open was always balbus' first question in testing a lodging: and does the chimney smoke his second. satisfied on all points, he secured the refusal of the room, and they moved on to number twenty-five. this landlady was grave and stern. i've nobbut one room left, she told them: and it gives on the back-gyardin. but there are cabbages balbus suggested. the landlady visibly relented. there is, sir, she said: and good ones, though i say it as shouldn't. we can't rely on the shops for greens. so we grows them ourselves. a singular advantage, said balbus: and, after the usual questions, they went on to fifty-two. and i'd gladly accommodate you all, if i could, was the greeting that met them. we are but mortal, (irrelevant muttered balbus) and i've let all my rooms but one. which one is a back-room, i perceive, said balbus: and looking out on on cabbages, i presume yes, indeed, sir said their hostess. whatever other folks may do, we grows our own. for the shops an excellent arrangement balbus interrupted. then one can really depend on their being good. does the window open the usual questions were answered satisfactorily: but this time hugh added one of his own invention does the cat scratch the landlady looked round suspiciously, as if to make sure the cat was not listening, i will not deceive you, gentlemen, she said. it do scratch, but not without you pulls its whiskers it'll never do it, she repeated slowly, with a visible effort to recall the exact words of some written agreement between herself and the cat, without you pulls its whiskers much may be excused in a cat so treated, said balbus, as they left the house and crossed to number seventy-three, leaving the landlady curtseying on the doorstep, and still murmuring to herself her parting words, as if they were a form of blessing, not without you pulls its whiskers at number seventy-three they found only a small shy girl to show the house, who said yes'm in answer to all questions. the usual room, said balbus, as they marched in: the usual back-garden, the usual cabbages. i suppose you can't get them good at the shops yes'm, said the girl. well, you may tell your mistress we will take the room, and that her plan of growing her own cabbages is simply admirable yes'm, said the girl, as she showed them out. one day-room and three bed-rooms, said balbus, as they returned to the hotel. we will take as our day-room the one that gives us the least walking to do to get to it. must we walk from door to door, and count the steps said lambert. no, no figure it out, my boys, figure it out balbus gaily exclaimed, as he put pens, ink, and paper before his hapless pupils, and left the room. i say it'll be a job said hugh. rather said lambert. well, they call me so because i am a little mad, i suppose, she said, good-humouredly, in answer to clara's cautiously-worded question as to how she came by so strange a nick-name. you see, i never do what sane people are expected to do now-a-days. i never wear long trains, (talking of trains, that's the charing cross metropolitan station i've something to tell you about that ), and i never play lawn-tennis. i can't cook an omelette. i can't even set a broken limb there's an ignoramus for you clara was her niece, and full twenty years her junior; in fact, she was still attending a high school an institution of which mad mathesis spoke with undisguised aversion. let a woman be meek and lowly she would say. none of your high schools for me but it was vacation-time just now, and clara was her guest, and mad mathesis was showing her the sights of that eighth wonder of the world london. the charing cross metropolitan station she resumed, waving her hand towards the entrance as if she were introducing her niece to a friend. the bayswater and birmingham extension is just completed, and the trains now run round and round continuously skirting the border of wales, just touching at york, and so round by the east coast back to london. the way the trains run is most peculiar. the westerly ones go round in two hours; the easterly ones take three; but they always manage to start two trains from here, opposite ways, punctually every quarter-of-an-hour. they part to meet again, said clara, her eyes filling with tears at the romantic thought. no need to cry about it her aunt grimly remarked. they don't meet on the same line of rails, you know. talking of meeting, an idea strikes me she added, changing the subject with her usual abruptness. let's go opposite ways round, and see which can meet most trains. no need for a chaperon ladies' saloon, you know. you shall go whichever way you like, and we'll have a bet about it i never make bets, clara said very gravely. our excellent preceptress has often warned us you'd be none the worse if you did mad mathesis interrupted. in fact, you'd be the better, i'm certain neither does our excellent preceptress approve of puns, said clara. but we'll have a match, if you like. let me choose my train, she added after a brief mental calculation, and i'll engage to meet exactly half as many again as you do. not if you count fair, mad mathesis bluntly interrupted. remember, we only count the trains we meet on the way . you mustn't count the one that starts as you start, nor the one that arrives as you arrive. that will only make the difference of one train, said clara, as they turned and entered the station. but i never travelled alone before. there'll be no one to help me to alight. however, i don't mind. let's have a match. a ragged little boy overheard her remark, and came running after her. buy a box of cigar-lights, miss he pleaded, pulling her shawl to attract her attention. clara stopped to explain. i never smoke cigars, she said in a meekly apologetic tone. our excellent preceptress , but mad mathesis impatiently hurried her on, and the little boy was left gazing after her with round eyes of amazement. the two ladies bought their tickets and moved slowly down the central platform, mad mathesis prattling on as usual clara silent, anxiously reconsidering the calculation on which she rested her hopes of winning the match. mind where you go, dear cried her aunt, checking her just in time. one step more, and you'd have been in that pail of cold water i know, i know, clara said, dreamily. the pale, the cold, and the moony take your places on the spring-boards shouted a porter. what are they for clara asked in a terrified whisper. merely to help us into the trains. the elder lady spoke with the nonchalance of one quite used to the process. very few people can get into a carriage without help in less than three seconds, and the trains only stop for one second. at this moment the whistle was heard, and two trains rushed into the station. a moment's pause, and they were gone again; but in that brief interval several hundred passengers had been shot into them, each flying straight to his place with the accuracy of a minie bullet while an equal number were showered out upon the side-platforms. three hours had passed away, and the two friends met again on the charing cross platform, and eagerly compared notes. then clara turned away with a sigh. to young impulsive hearts, like hers, disappointment is always a bitter pill. mad mathesis followed her, full of kindly sympathy. try again, my love she said, cheerily. let us vary the experiment. we will start as we did before, but not to begin counting till our trains meet. when we see each other, we will say 'one ' and so count on till we come here again. clara brightened up. i shall win that , she exclaimed eagerly, if i may choose my train another shriek of engine whistles, another upheaving of spring-boards, another living avalanche plunging into two trains as they flashed by: and the travellers were off again. each gazed eagerly from her carriage window, holding up her handkerchief as a signal to her friend. a rush and a roar. two trains shot past each other in a tunnel, and two travellers leaned back in their corners with a sigh or rather with two sighs of relief. one clara murmured to herself. won it's a word of good omen. this time, at any rate, the victory will be mine but was it noonday on the open sea within a few degrees of the equator is apt to be oppressively warm; and our two travellers were now airily clad in suits of dazzling white linen, having laid aside the chain-armour which they had found not only endurable in the cold mountain air they had lately been breathing, but a necessary precaution against the daggers of the banditti who infested the heights. their holiday-trip was over, and they were now on their way home, in the monthly packet which plied between the two great ports of the island they had been exploring. along with their armour, the tourists had laid aside the antiquated speech it had pleased them to affect while in knightly disguise, and had returned to the ordinary style of two country gentlemen of the twentieth century. stretched on a pile of cushions, under the shade of a huge umbrella, they were lazily watching some native fishermen, who had come on board at the last landing-place, each carrying over his shoulder a small but heavy sack. a large weighing-machine, that had been used for cargo at the last port, stood on the deck; and round this the fishermen had gathered, and, with much unintelligible jabber, seemed to be weighing their sacks. more like sparrows in a tree than human talk, isn't it the elder tourist remarked to his son, who smiled feebly, but would not exert himself so far as to speak. the old man tried another listener. what have they got in those sacks, captain he inquired, as that great being passed them in his never ending parade to and fro on the deck. the captain paused in his march, and towered over the travellers tall, grave, and serenely self-satisfied. fishermen, he explained, are often passengers in my ship. these five are from mhruxi the place we last touched at and that's the way they carry their money. the money of this island is heavy, gentlemen, but it costs little, as you may guess. we buy it from them by weight about five shillings a pound. i fancy a ten pound-note would buy all those sacks. by this time the old man had closed his eyes in order, no doubt, to concentrate his thoughts on these interesting facts; but the captain failed to realise his motive, and with a grunt resumed his monotonous march. meanwhile the fishermen were getting so noisy over the weighing-machine that one of the sailors took the precaution of carrying off all the weights, leaving them to amuse themselves with such substitutes in the form of winch-handles, belaying-pins, etc., as they could find. this brought their excitement to a speedy end: they carefully hid their sacks in the folds of the jib that lay on the deck near the tourists, and strolled away. when next the captain's heavy footfall passed, the younger man roused himself to speak. what did you call the place those fellows came from, captain he asked. mhruxi, sir. and the one we are bound for the captain took a long breath, plunged into the word, and came out of it nobly. they call it kgovjni, sir. k i give it up the young man faintly said. he stretched out his hand for a glass of iced water which the compassionate steward had brought him a minute ago, and had set down, unluckily, just outside the shadow of the umbrella. it was scalding hot, and he decided not to drink it. the effort of making this resolution, coming close on the fatiguing conversation he had just gone through, was too much for him: he sank back among the cushions in silence. his father courteously tried to make amends for his nonchalance . whereabouts are we now, captain said he, have you any idea the captain cast a pitying look on the ignorant landsman. i could tell you that , sir, he said, in a tone of lofty condescension, to an inch you don't say so the old man remarked, in a tone of languid surprise. and mean so, persisted the captain. why, what do you suppose would become of my ship, if i were to lose my longitude and my latitude could you make anything of my dead reckoning nobody could, i'm sure the other heartily rejoined. but he had overdone it. it's perfectly intelligible, the captain said, in an offended tone, to any one that understands such things. with these words he moved away, and began giving orders to the men, who were preparing to hoist the jib. our tourists watched the operation with such interest that neither of them remembered the five money-bags, which in another moment, as the wind filled out the jib, were whirled overboard and fell heavily into the sea. but the poor fishermen had not so easily forgotten their property. in a moment they had rushed to the spot, and stood uttering cries of fury, and pointing, now to the sea, and now to the sailors who had caused the disaster. the old man explained it to the captain. let us make it up among us, he added in conclusion. ten pounds will do it, i think you said but the captain put aside the suggestion with a wave of the hand. no, sir he said, in his grandest manner. you will excuse me, i am sure; but these are my passengers. the accident has happened on board my ship, and under my orders. it is for me to make compensation. he turned to the angry fishermen. come here, my men he said, in the mhruxian dialect. tell me the weight of each sack. i saw you weighing them just now. then ensued a perfect babel of noise, as the five natives explained, all screaming together, how the sailors had carried off the weights, and they had done what they could with whatever came handy. two iron belaying-pins, three blocks, six holystones, four winch-handles, and a large hammer, were now carefully weighed, the captain superintending and noting the results. but the matter did not seem to be settled, even then: an angry discussion followed, in which the sailors and the five natives all joined: and at last the captain approached our tourists with a disconcerted look, which he tried to conceal under a laugh. it's an absurd difficulty, he said. perhaps one of you gentlemen can suggest something. it seems they weighed the sacks two at a time if they didn't have five separate weighings, of course you can't value them separately, the youth hastily decided. let's hear all about it, was the old man's more cautious remark. they did have five separate weighings, the captain said, but well, it beats me entirely he added, in a sudden burst of candour. here's the result. first and second sack weighed twelve pounds; second and third, thirteen and a half; third and fourth, eleven and a half; fourth and fifth, eight: and then they say they had only the large hammer left, and it took three sacks to weigh it down that's the first, third and fifth and they weighed sixteen pounds. there, gentlemen did you ever hear anything like that the old man muttered under his breath if only my sister were here and looked helplessly at his son. his son looked at the five natives. the five natives looked at the captain. the captain looked at nobody: his eyes were cast down, and he seemed to be saying softly to himself contemplate one another, gentlemen, if such be your good pleasure. i contemplate myself and what made you choose the first train, goosey said mad mathesis, as they got into the cab. couldn't you count better than that i took an extreme case, was the tearful reply. our excellent preceptress always says 'when in doubt, my dears, take an extreme case.' and i was in doubt. does it always succeed her aunt enquired. clara sighed. not always , she reluctantly admitted. and i can't make out why. one day she was telling the little girls they make such a noise at tea, you know 'the more noise you make, the less jam you will have, and vice versa .' and i thought they wouldn't know what ' vice versa ' meant: so i explained it to them. i said 'if you make an infinite noise, you'll get no jam: and if you make no noise, you'll get an infinite lot of jam.' but our excellent preceptress said that wasn't a good instance. why wasn't it she added plaintively. her aunt evaded the question. one sees certain objections to it, she said. but how did you work it with the metropolitan trains none of them go infinitely fast, i believe. i called them hares and tortoises, clara said a little timidly, for she dreaded being laughed at. and i thought there couldn't be so many hares as tortoises on the line: so i took an extreme case one hare and an infinite number of tortoises. an extreme case, indeed, her aunt remarked with admirable gravity: and a most dangerous state of things and i thought, if i went with a tortoise, there would be only one hare to meet: but if i went with the hare you know there were crowds of tortoises it wasn't a bad idea, said the elder lady, as they left the cab, at the entrance of burlington house. you shall have another chance to-day. we'll have a match in marking pictures. clara brightened up. i should like to try again, very much, she said. i'll take more care this time. how are we to play to this question mad mathesis made no reply: she was busy drawing lines down the margins of the catalogue. see, she said after a minute, i've drawn three columns against the names of the pictures in the long room, and i want you to fill them with oughts and crosses crosses for good marks and oughts for bad. the first column is for choice of subject, the second for arrangement, the third for colouring. and these are the conditions of the match. you must give three crosses to two or three pictures. you must give two crosses to four or five do you mean only two crosses said clara. or may i count the three-cross pictures among the two-cross pictures of course you may, said her aunt. any one, that has three eyes, may be said to have two eyes, i suppose clara followed her aunt's dreamy gaze across the crowded gallery, half-dreading to find that there was a three-eyed person in sight. and you must give one cross to nine or ten. and which wins the match clara asked, as she carefully entered these conditions on a blank leaf in her catalogue. whichever marks fewest pictures. but suppose we marked the same number then whichever uses most marks. clara considered. i don't think it's much of a match, she said. i shall mark nine pictures, and give three crosses to three of them, two crosses to two more, and one cross each to all the rest. will you, indeed said her aunt. wait till you've heard all the conditions, my impetuous child. you must give three oughts to one or two pictures, two oughts to three or four, and one ought to eight or nine. i don't want you to be too hard on the r.a.'s. clara quite gasped as she wrote down all these fresh conditions. it's a great deal worse than circulating decimals she said. but i'm determined to win, all the same her aunt smiled grimly. we can begin here , she said, as they paused before a gigantic picture, which the catalogue informed them was the portrait of lieutenant brown, mounted on his favorite elephant. he looks awfully conceited said clara. i don't think he was the elephant's favorite lieutenant. what a hideous picture it is and it takes up room enough for twenty mind what you say, my dear her aunt interposed. it's by an r.a. but clara was quite reckless. i don't care who it's by she cried. and i shall give it three bad marks aunt and niece soon drifted away from each other in the crowd, and for the next half-hour clara was hard at work, putting in marks and rubbing them out again, and hunting up and down for suitable pictures. this she found the hardest part of all. i can't find the one i want she exclaimed at last, almost crying with vexation. what is it you want to find, my dear the voice was strange to clara, but so sweet and gentle that she felt attracted to the owner of it, even before she had seen her; and when she turned, and met the smiling looks of two little old ladies, whose round dimpled faces, exactly alike, seemed never to have known a care, it was as much as she could do as she confessed to aunt mattie afterwards to keep herself from hugging them both. i was looking for a picture, she said, that has a good subject and that's well arranged but badly coloured. the little old ladies glanced at each other in some alarm. calm yourself, my dear, said the one who had spoken first, and try to remember which it was. what was the subject was it an elephant, for instance the other sister suggested. they were still in sight of lieutenant brown. i don't know, indeed clara impetuously replied. you know it doesn't matter a bit what the subject is , so long as it's a good one once more the sisters exchanged looks of alarm, and one of them whispered something to the other, of which clara caught only the one word mad. they mean aunt mattie, of course, she said to herself fancying, in her innocence, that london was like her native town, where everybody knew everybody else. if you mean my aunt, she added aloud, she's there just three pictures beyond lieutenant brown. ah, well then you'd better go to her, my dear her new friend said, soothingly. she'll find you the picture you want. good-bye, dear good-bye, dear echoed the other sister, mind you don't lose sight of your aunt and the pair trotted off into another room, leaving clara rather perplexed at their manner. they're real darlings she soliloquised. i wonder why they pity me so and she wandered on, murmuring to herself it must have two good marks, and one piecee thing that my have got, masked that thing my no can do. you talkee you no sabey what bamboo. they landed, and were at once conducted to the palace. about half way they were met by the governor, who welcomed them in english a great relief to our travellers, whose guide could speak nothing but kgovjnian. i don't half like the way they grin at us as we go by the old man whispered to his son. and why do they say 'bamboo ' so often it alludes to a local custom, replied the governor, who had overheard the question. such persons as happen in any way to displease her radiancy are usually beaten with rods. the old man shuddered. a most objectional local custom he remarked with strong emphasis. i wish we had never landed did you notice that black fellow, norman, opening his great mouth at us i verily believe he would like to eat us norman appealed to the governor, who was walking at his other side. do they often eat distinguished strangers here he said, in as indifferent a tone as he could assume. not often not ever was the welcome reply. they are not good for it. pigs we eat, for they are fat. this old man is thin. and thankful to be so muttered the elder traveller. beaten we shall be without a doubt. it's a comfort to know it won't be beaten without the b my dear boy, just look at the peacocks they were now walking between two unbroken lines of those gorgeous birds, each held in check, by means of a golden collar and chain, by a black slave, who stood well behind, so as not to interrupt the view of the glittering tail, with its network of rustling feathers and its hundred eyes. the governor smiled proudly. in your honour, he said, her radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional peacocks. she will, no doubt, decorate you, before you go, with the usual star and feathers. it'll be star without the s faltered one of his hearers. come, come don't lose heart said the other. all this is full of charm for me. you are young, norman, sighed his father; young and light-hearted. for me, it is charm without the c. the old one is sad, the governor remarked with some anxiety. he has, without doubt, effected some fearful crime but i haven't the poor old gentleman hastily exclaimed. tell him i haven't, norman he has not, as yet, norman gently explained. and the governor repeated, in a satisfied tone, not as yet. yours is a wondrous country the governor resumed, after a pause. now here is a letter from a friend of mine, a merchant, in london. he and his brother went there a year ago, with a thousand pounds apiece; and on new-year's-day they had sixty thousand pounds between them how did they do it norman eagerly exclaimed. even the elder traveller looked excited. the governor handed him the open letter. anybody can do it, when once they know how, so ran this oracular document. we borrowed nought: we stole nought. we began the year with only a thousand pounds apiece: and last new-year's-day we had sixty thousand pounds between us sixty thousand golden sovereigns norman looked grave and thoughtful as he handed back the letter. his father hazarded one guess. was it by gambling a kgovjnian never gambles, said the governor gravely, as he ushered them through the palace gates. they followed him in silence down a long passage, and soon found themselves in a lofty hall, lined entirely with peacocks' feathers. in the centre was a pile of crimson cushions, which almost concealed the figure of her radiancy a plump little damsel, in a robe of green satin dotted with silver stars, whose pale round face lit up for a moment with a half-smile as the travellers bowed before her, and then relapsed into the exact expression of a wax doll, while she languidly murmured a word or two in the kgovjnian dialect. the governor interpreted. her radiancy welcomes you. she notes the impenetrable placidity of the old one, and the imperceptible acuteness of the youth. here the little potentate clapped her hands, and a troop of slaves instantly appeared, carrying trays of coffee and sweetmeats, which they offered to the guests, who had, at a signal from the governor, seated themselves on the carpet. sugar-plums muttered the old man. one might as well be at a confectioner's ask for a penny bun, norman not so loud his son whispered. say something complimentary for the governor was evidently expecting a speech. we thank her exalted potency, the old man timidly began. we bask in the light of her smile, which the words of old men are weak the governor interrupted angrily. let the youth speak tell her, cried norman, in a wild burst of eloquence, that, like two grasshoppers in a volcano, we are shrivelled up in the presence of her spangled vehemence it is well, said the governor, and translated this into kgovjnian. i am now to tell you, he proceeded, what her radiancy requires of you before you go. the yearly competition for the post of imperial scarf-maker is just ended; you are the judges. you will take account of the rate of work, the lightness of the scarves, and their warmth. usually the competitors differ in one point only. thus, last year, fifi and gogo made the same number of scarves in the trial-week, and they were equally light; but fifi's were twice as warm as gogo's and she was pronounced twice as good. but this year, woe is me, who can judge it three competitors are here, and they differ in all points while you settle their claims, you shall be lodged, her radiancy bids me say, free of expense in the best dungeon, and abundantly fed on the best bread and water. the old man groaned. all is lost he wildly exclaimed. but norman heeded him not: he had taken out his note-book, and was calmly jotting down the particulars. three they be, the governor proceeded, lolo, mimi, and zuzu. lolo makesscarves while mimi makes but zuzu makeswhile lolo makes again, so fairylike is zuzu's handiwork,of her scarves weigh no more than one of lolo's; yet mimi's is lighter still-of hers will but balanceof zuzu's and for warmth one of mimi's is equal toof zuzu's; yet one of lolo's is as warm asof mimi's here the little lady once more clapped her hands. it is our signal of dismissal the governor hastily said. pay her radiancy your farewell compliments and walk out backwards. the walking part was all the elder tourist could manage. norman simply said tell her radiancy we are transfixed by the spectacle of her serene brilliance, and bid an agonized farewell to her condensed milkiness her radiancy is pleased, the governor reported, after duly translating this. she casts on you a glance from her imperial eyes, and is confident that you will catch it that i warrant we shall the elder traveller moaned to himself distractedly. once more they bowed low, and then followed the governor down a winding staircase to the imperial dungeon, which they found to be lined with coloured marble, lighted from the roof, and splendidly though not luxuriously furnished with a bench of polished malachite. i trust you will not delay the calculation, the governor said, ushering them in with much ceremony. i have known great inconvenience great and serious inconvenience result to those unhappy ones who have delayed to execute the commands of her radiancy and on this occasion she is resolute: she says the thing must and shall be done: and she has ordered up ten thousand additional bamboos with these words he left them, and they heard him lock and bar the door on the outside. i told you how it would end moaned the elder traveller, wringing his hands, and quite forgetting in his anguish that he had himself proposed the expedition, and had never predicted anything of the sort. oh that we were well out of this miserable business courage cried the younger cheerily. hac olim meminisse juvabit the end of all this will be glory glory without the l was all the poor old man could say, as he rocked himself to and fro on the malachite bench. glory without the l base is the slave that pays. aunt mattie my child would you mind writing it down at once i shall be quite certain to forget it if you don't my dear, we really must wait till the cab stops. how can i possibly write anything in the midst of all this jolting but really i shall be forgetting it clara's voice took the plaintive tone that her aunt never knew how to resist, and with a sigh the old lady drew forth her ivory tablets and prepared to record the amount that clara had just spent at the confectioner's shop. her expenditure was always made out of her aunt's purse, but the poor girl knew, by bitter experience, that sooner or later mad mathesis would expect an exact account of every penny that had gone, and she waited, with ill-concealed impatience, while the old lady turned the tablets over and over, till she had found the one headed petty cash. here's the place, she said at last, and here we have yesterday's luncheon duly entered. one glass lemonade (why can't you drink water, like me ) three sandwiches (they never put in half mustard enough. i told the young woman so, to her face; and she tossed her head like her impudence ) and seven biscuits . total one-and-two-pence. well, now for to-day's one glass of lemonade clara was beginning to say, when suddenly the cab drew up, and a courteous railway-porter was handing out the bewildered girl before she had had time to finish her sentence. her aunt pocketed the tablets instantly. business first, she said: petty cash which is a form of pleasure, whatever you may think afterwards. and she proceeded to pay the driver, and to give voluminous orders about the luggage, quite deaf to the entreaties of her unhappy niece that she would enter the rest of the luncheon account. my dear, you really must cultivate a more capacious mind was all the consolation she vouchsafed to the poor girl. are not the tablets of your memory wide enough to contain the record of one single luncheon not wide enough not half wide enough was the passionate reply. the words came in aptly enough, but the voice was not that of clara, and both ladies turned in some surprise to see who it was that had so suddenly struck into their conversation. a fat little old lady was standing at the door of a cab, helping the driver to extricate what seemed an exact duplicate of herself: it would have been no easy task to decide which was the fatter, or which looked the more good-humoured of the two sisters. i tell you the cab-door isn't half wide enough she repeated, as her sister finally emerged, somewhat after the fashion of a pellet from a pop-gun, and she turned to appeal to clara. is it, dear she said, trying hard to bring a frown into a face that dimpled all over with smiles. some folks is too wide for 'em, growled the cab-driver. don't provoke me, man cried the little old lady, in what she meant for a tempest of fury. say another word and i'll put you into the county court, and sue you for a habeas corpus the cabman touched his hat, and marched off, grinning. nothing like a little law to cow the ruffians, my dear she remarked confidentially to clara. you saw how he quailed when i mentioned the habeas corpus not that i've any idea what it means, but it sounds very grand, doesn't it it's very provoking, clara replied, a little vaguely. very the little old lady eagerly repeated. and we're very much provoked indeed. aren't we, sister i never was so provoked in all my life the fatter sister assented, radiantly. by this time clara had recognised her picture-gallery acquaintances, and, drawing her aunt aside, she hastily whispered her reminiscences. i met them first in the royal academy and they were very kind to me and they were lunching at the next table to us, just now, you know and they tried to help me to find the picture i wanted and i'm sure they're dear old things friends of yours, are they said mad mathesis. well, i like their looks. you can be civil to them, while i get the tickets. but do try and arrange your ideas a little more chronologically and so it came to pass that the four ladies found themselves seated side by side on the same bench waiting for the train, and chatting as if they had known one another for years. now this i call quite a remarkable coincidence exclaimed the smaller and more talkative of the two sisters the one whose legal knowledge had annihilated the cab-driver. not only that we should be waiting for the same train, and at the same station that would be curious enough but actually on the same day, and the same hour of the day that's what strikes me so forcibly she glanced at the fatter and more silent sister, whose chief function in life seemed to be to support the family opinion, and who meekly responded and me too, sister those are not independent coincidences mad mathesis was just beginning, when clara ventured to interpose. there's no jolting here, she pleaded meekly. would you mind writing it down now out came the ivory tablets once more. what was it, then said her aunt. one glass of lemonade, one sandwich, one biscuit oh dear me cried poor clara, the historical tone suddenly changing to a wail of agony. toothache said her aunt calmly, as she wrote down the items. the two sisters instantly opened their reticules and produced two different remedies for neuralgia, each marked unequalled. it isn't that said poor clara. thank you very much. it's only that i can't remember how much i paid well, try and make it out, then, said her aunt. you've got yesterday's luncheon to help you, you know. and here's the luncheon we had the day before the first day we went to that shop one glass lemonade , four sandwiches , ten biscuits . total, one-and-fivepence. she handed the tablets to clara, who gazed at them with eyes so dim with tears that she did not at first notice that she was holding them upside down. the two sisters had been listening to all this with the deepest interest, and at this juncture the smaller one softly laid her hand on clara's arm. do you know, my dear, she said coaxingly, my sister and i are in the very same predicament quite identically the very same predicament aren't we, sister quite identically and absolutely the very began the fatter sister, but she was constructing her sentence on too large a scale, and the little one would not wait for her to finish it. yes, my dear, she resumed; we were lunching at the very same shop as you were and we had two glasses of lemonade and three sandwiches and five biscuits and neither of us has the least idea what we paid. have we, sister quite identically and absolutely murmured the other, who evidently considered that she was now a whole sentence in arrears, and that she ought to discharge one obligation before contracting any fresh liabilities; but the little lady broke in again, and she retired from the conversation a bankrupt. would you make it out for us, my dear pleaded the little old lady. you can do arithmetic, i trust her aunt said, a little anxiously, as clara turned from one tablet to another, vainly trying to collect her thoughts. her mind was a blank, and all human expression was rapidly fading out of her face. a gloomy silence ensued. this little pig went to market: this little pig staid at home. by her radiancy's express command, said the governor, as he conducted the travellers, for the last time, from the imperial presence, i shall now have the ecstasy of escorting you as far as the outer gate of the military quarter, where the agony of parting if indeed nature can survive the shock must be endured from that gate grurmstipths start every quarter of an hour, both ways would you mind repeating that word said norman. grurm grurmstipths, the governor repeated. you call them omnibuses in england. they run both ways, and you can travel by one of them all the way down to the harbour. the old man breathed a sigh of relief; four hours of courtly ceremony had wearied him, and he had been in constant terror lest something should call into use the ten thousand additional bamboos. in another minute they were crossing a large quadrangle, paved with marble, and tastefully decorated with a pigsty in each corner. soldiers, carrying pigs, were marching in all directions: and in the middle stood a gigantic officer giving orders in a voice of thunder, which made itself heard above all the uproar of the pigs. it is the commander-in-chief the governor hurriedly whispered to his companions, who at once followed his example in prostrating themselves before the great man. the commander gravely bowed in return. he was covered with gold lace from head to foot: his face wore an expression of deep misery: and he had a little black pig under each arm. still the gallant fellow did his best, in the midst of the orders he was every moment issuing to his men, to bid a courteous farewell to the departing guests. farewell, oh old one carry these three to the south corner and farewell to thee, thou young one put this fat one on the top of the others in the western sty may your shadows never be less woe is me, it is wrongly done empty out all the sties, and begin again and the soldier leant upon his sword, and wiped away a tear. he is in distress, the governor explained as they left the court. her radiancy has commanded him to place twenty-four pigs in those four sties, so that, as she goes round the court, she may always find the number in each sty nearer to ten than the number in the last. does she call ten nearer to ten than nine is said norman. surely, said the governor. her radiancy would admit that ten is nearer to ten than nine is and also nearer than eleven is. then i think it can be done, said norman. the governor shook his head. the commander has been transferring them in vain for four months, he said. what hope remains and her radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional the pigs don't seem to enjoy being transferred, the old man hastily interrupted. he did not like the subject of bamboos. they are only provisionally transferred, you know, said the governor. in most cases they are immediately carried back again: so they need not mind it. and all is done with the greatest care, under the personal superintendence of the commander-in-chief. of course she would only go once round said norman. alas, no sighed their conductor. round and round. round and round. these are her radiancy's own words. but oh, agony here is the outer gate, and we must part he sobbed as he shook hands with them, and the next moment was briskly walking away. he might have waited to see us off said the old man, piteously. and he needn't have begun whistling the very moment he left us said the young one, severely. but look sharp here are two what's-his-names in the act of starting unluckily, the sea-bound omnibus was full. never mind said norman, cheerily. we'll walk on till the next one overtakes us. they trudged on in silence, both thinking over the military problem, till they met an omnibus coming from the sea. the elder traveller took out his watch. just twelve minutes and a half since we started, he remarked in an absent manner. suddenly the vacant face brightened; the old man had an idea. my boy he shouted, bringing his hand down upon norman's shoulder so suddenly as for a moment to transfer his centre of gravity beyond the base of support. thus taken off his guard, the young man wildly staggered forwards, and seemed about to plunge into space: but in another moment he had gracefully recovered himself. problem in precession and nutation, he remarked in tones where filial respect only just managed to conceal a shade of annoyance. what is it he hastily added, fearing his father might have been taken ill. will you have some brandy when will the next omnibus overtake us when when the old man cried, growing more excited every moment. norman looked gloomy. give me time, he said. i must think it over. and once more the travellers passed on in silence a silence only broken by the distant squeals of the unfortunate little pigs, who were still being provisionally transferred from sty to sty, under the personal superintendence of the commander-in-chief. water, water, every where, nor any drop to drink. it'll just take one more pebble. what ever are you doing with those buckets the speakers were hugh and lambert. place, the beach of little mendip. time,30, p.m. hugh was floating a bucket in another a size larger, and trying how many pebbles it would carry without sinking. lambert was lying on his back, doing nothing. for the next minute or two hugh was silent, evidently deep in thought. suddenly he started. i say, look here, lambert he cried. if it's alive, and slimy, and with legs, i don't care to, said lambert. didn't balbus say this morning that, if a body is immersed in liquid, it displaces as much liquid as is equal to its own bulk said hugh. he said things of that sort, lambert vaguely replied. well, just look here a minute. here's the little bucket almost quite immersed: so the water displaced ought to be just about the same bulk. and now just look at it he took out the little bucket as he spoke, and handed the big one to lambert. why, there's hardly a teacupful do you mean to say that water is the same bulk as the little bucket course it is, said lambert. well, look here again cried hugh, triumphantly, as he poured the water from the big bucket into the little one. why, it doesn't half fill it that's its business, said lambert. if balbus says it's the same bulk, why, it is the same bulk, you know. well, i don't believe it, said hugh. you needn't, said lambert. besides, it's dinner-time. come along. they found balbus waiting dinner for them, and to him hugh at once propounded his difficulty. let's get you helped first, said balbus, briskly cutting away at the joint. you know the old proverb 'mutton first, mechanics afterwards' the boys did not know the proverb, but they accepted it in perfect good faith, as they did every piece of information, however startling, that came from so infallible an authority as their tutor. they ate on steadily in silence, and, when dinner was over, hugh set out the usual array of pens, ink, and paper, while balbus repeated to them the problem he had prepared for their afternoon's task. a friend of mine has a flower-garden a very pretty one, though no great size how big is it said hugh. that's what you have to find out balbus gaily replied. all i tell you is that it is oblong in shape just half a yard longer than its width and that a gravel-walk, one yard wide, begins at one corner and runs all round it. joining into itself said hugh. not joining into itself, young man. just before doing that , it turns a corner, and runs round the garden again, alongside of the first portion, and then inside that again, winding in and in, and each lap touching the last one, till it has used up the whole of the area. like a serpent with corners said lambert. exactly so. and if you walk the whole length of it, to the last inch, keeping in the centre of the path, it's exactly two miles and half a furlong. now, while you find out the length and breadth of the garden, i'll see if i can think out that sea-water puzzle. you said it was a flower-garden hugh inquired, as balbus was leaving the room. i did, said balbus. where do the flowers grow said hugh. but balbus thought it best not to hear the question. he left the boys to their problem, and, in the silence of his own room, set himself to unravel hugh's mechanical paradox. to fix our thoughts, he murmured to himself, as, with hands deep-buried in his pockets, he paced up and down the room, we will take a cylindrical glass jar, with a scale of inches marked up the side, and fill it with water up to theinch mark: and we will assume that every inch depth of jar contains a pint of water. we will now take a solid cylinder, such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to half a pint of water, and plungeinches of it into the water, so that the end of the cylinder comes down to theinch mark. well, that displacespints of water. what becomes of them why, if there were no more cylinder, they would lie comfortably on the top, and fill the jar up to theinch mark. but unfortunately there is more cylinder, occupying half the space between theinch and theinch marks, so that only one pint of water can be accommodated there. what becomes of the other pint why, if there were no more cylinder, it would lie on the top, and fill the jar up to theinch mark. but unfortunately shade of newton he exclaimed, in sudden accents of terror. when does the water stop rising a bright idea struck him. i'll write a little essay on it, he said. balbus's essay. when a solid is immersed in a liquid, it is well known that it displaces a portion of the liquid equal to itself in bulk, and that the level of the liquid rises just so much as it would rise if a quantity of liquid had been added to it, equal in bulk to the solid. lardner says, precisely the same process occurs when a solid is partially immersed: the quantity of liquid displaced, in this case, equalling the portion of the solid which is immersed, and the rise of the level being in proportion. suppose a solid held above the surface of a liquid and partially immersed: a portion of the liquid is displaced, and the level of the liquid rises. but, by this rise of level, a little bit more of the solid is of course immersed, and so there is a new displacement of a second portion of the liquid, and a consequent rise of level. again, this second rise of level causes a yet further immersion, and by consequence another displacement of liquid and another rise. it is self-evident that this process must continue till the entire solid is immersed, and that the liquid will then begin to immerse whatever holds the solid, which, being connected with it, must for the time be considered a part of it. if you hold a stick, six feet long, with its end in a tumbler of water, and wait long enough, you must eventually be immersed. the question as to the source from which the water is supplied which belongs to a high branch of mathematics, and is therefore beyond our present scope does not apply to the sea. let us therefore take the familiar instance of a man standing at the edge of the sea, at ebb-tide, with a solid in his hand, which he partially immerses: he remains steadfast and unmoved, and we all know that he must be drowned. the multitudes who daily perish in this manner to attest a philosophical truth, and whose bodies the unreasoning wave casts sullenly upon our thankless shores, have a truer claim to be called the martyrs of science than a galileo or a kepler. to use kossuth's eloquent phrase, they are the unnamed demigods of the nineteenth century. there's a fallacy somewhere , he murmured drowsily, as he stretched his long legs upon the sofa. i must think it over again. he closed his eyes, in order to concentrate his attention more perfectly, and for the next hour or so his slow and regular breathing bore witness to the careful deliberation with which he was investigating this new and perplexing view of the subject. how very, very sad exclaimed clara; and the eyes of the gentle girl filled with tears as she spoke. sad but very curious when you come to look at it arithmetically, was her aunt's less romantic reply. some of them have lost an arm in their country's service, some a leg, some an ear, some an eye and some, perhaps, all clara murmured dreamily, as they passed the long rows of weather-beaten heroes basking in the sun. did you notice that very old one, with a red face, who was drawing a map in the dust with his wooden leg, and all the others watching i think it was a plan of a battle the battle of trafalgar, no doubt, her aunt interrupted, briskly. hardly that, i think, clara ventured to say. you see, in that case, he couldn't well be alive couldn't well be alive the old lady contemptuously repeated. he's as lively as you and me put together why, if drawing a map in the dust with one's wooden leg doesn't prove one to be alive, perhaps you'll kindly mention what does prove it clara did not see her way out of it. logic had never been her forte . to return to the arithmetic, mad mathesis resumed the eccentric old lady never let slip an opportunity of driving her niece into a calculation what percentage do you suppose must have lost all four a leg, an arm, an eye, and an ear how can i tell gasped the terrified girl. she knew well what was coming. you can't, of course, without data , her aunt replied: but i'm just going to give you give her a chelsea bun, miss that's what most young ladies likes best the voice was rich and musical, and the speaker dexterously whipped back the snowy cloth that covered his basket, and disclosed a tempting array of the familiar square buns, joined together in rows, richly egged and browned, and glistening in the sun. no, sir i shall give her nothing so indigestible be off the old lady waved her parasol threateningly: but nothing seemed to disturb the good-humour of the jolly old man, who marched on, chanting his melodious refrain: far too indigestible, my love said the old lady. percentages will agree with you ever so much better clara sighed, and there was a hungry look in her eyes as she watched the basket lessening in the distance: but she meekly listened to the relentless old lady, who at once proceeded to count off the data on her fingers. say thatper cent. have lost an eye-per cent. an ear-per cent. an arm-per cent. a leg that'll do it beautifully. now, my dear, what percentage, at least , must have lost all four no more conversation occurred unless a smothered exclamation of piping hot which escaped from clara's lips as the basket vanished round a corner could be counted as such until they reached the old chelsea mansion, where clara's father was then staying, with his three sons and their old tutor. balbus, lambert, and hugh had entered the house only a few minutes before them. they had been out walking, and hugh had been propounding a difficulty which had reduced lambert to the depths of gloom, and had even puzzled balbus. it changes from wednesday to thursday at midnight, doesn't it hugh had begun. sometimes, said balbus, cautiously. always, said lambert, decisively. sometimes , balbus gently insisted. six midnights out of seven, it changes to some other name. i meant, of course, hugh corrected himself, when it does change from wednesday to thursday, it does it at midnight and only at midnight. surely, said balbus. lambert was silent. well, now, suppose it's midnight here in chelsea. then it's wednesday west of chelsea (say in ireland or america) where midnight hasn't arrived yet: and it's thursday east of chelsea (say in germany or russia) where midnight has just passed by surely, balbus said again. even lambert nodded this time. but it isn't midnight, anywhere else; so it can't be changing from one day to another anywhere else. and yet, if ireland and america and so on call it wednesday, and germany and russia and so on call it thursday, there must be some place not chelsea that has different days on the two sides of it. and the worst of it is, the people there get their days in the wrong order: they've got wednesday east of them, and thursday west just as if their day had changed from thursday to wednesday i've heard that puzzle before cried lambert. and i'll tell you the explanation. when a ship goes round the world from east to west, we know that it loses a day in its reckoning: so that when it gets home, and calls its day wednesday, it finds people here calling it thursday, because we've had one more midnight than the ship has had. and when you go the other way round you gain a day. i know all that, said hugh, in reply to this not very lucid explanation: but it doesn't help me, because the ship hasn't proper days. one way round, you get more than twenty-four hours to the day, and the other way you get less: so of course the names get wrong: but people that live on in one place always get twenty-four hours to the day. i suppose there is such a place, balbus said, meditatively, though i never heard of it. and the people must find it very queer, as hugh says, to have the old day east of them, and the new one west : because, when midnight comes round to them, with the new day in front of it and the old one behind it, one doesn't see exactly what happens. i must think it over. so they had entered the house in the state i have described balbus puzzled, and lambert buried in gloomy thought. yes, m'm, master is at home, m'm, said the stately old butler. (n.b. it is only a butler of experience who can manage a series of three m's together, without any interjacent vowels.) and the ole party is a-waiting for you in the libery. i don't like his calling your father an old party, mad mathesis whispered to her niece, as they crossed the hall. and clara had only just time to whisper in reply he meant the whole party, before they were ushered into the library, and the sight of the five solemn faces there assembled chilled her into silence. her father sat at the head of the table, and mutely signed to the ladies to take the two vacant chairs, one on each side of him. his three sons and balbus completed the party. writing materials had been arranged round the table, after the fashion of a ghostly banquet: the butler had evidently bestowed much thought on the grim device. sheets of quarto paper, each flanked by a pen on one side and a pencil on the other, represented the plates penwipers did duty for rolls of bread while ink-bottles stood in the places usually occupied by wine-glasses. the piece de resistance was a large green baize bag, which gave forth, as the old man restlessly lifted it from side to side, a charming jingle, as of innumerable golden guineas. sister, daughter, sons and balbus , the old man began, so nervously, that balbus put in a gentle hear, hear while hugh drummed on the table with his fists. this disconcerted the unpractised orator. sister he began again, then paused a moment, moved the bag to the other side, and went on with a rush, i mean this being a critical occasion more or less being the year when one of my sons comes of age he paused again in some confusion, having evidently got into the middle of his speech sooner than he intended: but it was too late to go back. hear, hear cried balbus. quite so, said the old gentleman, recovering his self-possession a little: when first i began this annual custom my friend balbus will correct me if i am wrong (hugh whispered with a strap but nobody heard him except lambert, who only frowned and shook his head at him) this annual custom of giving each of my sons as many guineas as would represent his age it was a critical time so balbus informed me as the ages of two of you were together equal to that of the third so on that occasion i made a speech he paused so long that balbus thought it well to come to the rescue with the words it was a most but the old man checked him with a warning look: yes, made a speech, he repeated. a few years after that, balbus pointed out i say pointed out (hear, hear cried balbus. quite so, said the grateful old man.) that it was another critical occasion. the ages of two of you were together double that of the third. so i made another speech another speech. and now again it's a critical occasion so balbus says and i am making (here mad mathesis pointedly referred to her watch) all the haste i can the old man cried, with wonderful presence of mind. indeed, sister, i'm coming to the point now the number of years that have passed since that first occasion is just two-thirds of the number of guineas i then gave you. now, my boys, calculate your ages from the data , and you shall have the money but we know our ages cried hugh. silence, sir thundered the old man, rising to his full height (he was exactly five-foot five) in his indignation. i say you must use the data only you mustn't even assume which it is that comes of age he clutched the bag as he spoke, and with tottering steps (it was about as much as he could do to carry it) he left the room. and you shall have a similar cadeau , the old lady whispered to her niece, when you've calculated that percentage and she followed her brother. nothing could exceed the solemnity with which the old couple had risen from the table, and yet was it was it a grin with which the father turned away from his unhappy sons could it be could it be a wink with which the aunt abandoned her despairing niece and were those were those sounds of suppressed chuckling which floated into the room, just before balbus (who had followed them out) closed the door surely not: and yet the butler told the cook but no, that was merely idle gossip, and i will not repeat it. the shades of evening granted their unuttered petition, and closed not o'er them (for the butler brought in the lamp): the same obliging shades left them a lonely bark (the wail of a dog, in the back-yard, baying the moon) for awhile: but neither morn, alas, (nor any other epoch) seemed likely to restore them to that peace of mind which had once been theirs ere ever these problems had swooped upon them, and crushed them with a load of unfathomable mystery it's hardly fair, muttered hugh, to give us such a jumble as this to work out fair clara echoed, bitterly. well and to all my readers i can but repeat the last words of gentle clara fare-well twenty-seven answers have come in. of these,are right,partially right, andwrong. thegive the distance correctly, but they have failed to grasp the fact that the top of the hill might have been reached at any moment betweeno'clock and i grant you (i), but i deny (ii): it rests on the assumption that to go part of the time atmiles an hour, and the rest atmiles an hour, comes to the same result as going the whole time at1miles an hour. but this would only be true if the part were an exact half , i.e., if they went up hill forhours, and down hill for the other which they certainly did not do. and now descend, ye classic nine who have solved the whole problem, and let me sing your praises. your names are blithe, e. w., l. b., a marlborough boy, o. v. l., putney walker, rose, sea breeze, simple susan, and money spinner. (these last two i count as one, as they send a joint answer.) rose and simple susan and co. do not actually state that the hill-top was reached some time betweenand but, as they have clearly grasped the fact that a mile, ascended and descended, took the same time as two level miles, i mark them as right. a marlborough boy and putney walker deserve honourable mention for their algebraical solutions being the only two who have perceived that the question leads to an indeterminate equation . e. w. brings a charge of untruthfulness against the aged knight a serious charge, for he was the very pink of chivalry she says according to the data given, the time at the summit affords no clue to the total distance. it does not enable us to state precisely to an inch how much level and how much hill there was on the road. fair damsel, the aged knight replies, if, as i surmise, thy initials denote early womanhood bethink thee that the word 'enable' is thine, not mine. i did but ask the time of reaching the hill-top as my condition for further parley. if now thou wilt not grant that i am a truth-loving man, then will i affirm that those same initials denote envenomed wickedness blithe has made so ingenious an addition to the problem, and simple susan and co. have solved it in such tuneful verse, that i record both their answers in full. i have altered a word or two in blithe's which i trust she will excuse; it did not seem quite clear as it stood. yet stay, said the youth, as a gleam of inspiration lighted up the relaxing muscles of his quiescent features. stay. methinks it matters little when we reached that summit, the crown of our toil. for in the space of time wherein we clambered up one mile and bounded down the same on our return, we could have trudged the twain on the level. we have plodded, then, four-and-twenty miles in these six mortal hours; for never a moment did we stop for catching of fleeting breath or for gazing on the scene around very good, said the old man. twelve miles out and twelve miles in. and we reached the top some time between six and seven of the clock. now mark me for every five minutes that had fled since six of the clock when we stood on yonder peak, so many miles had we toiled upwards on the dreary mountainside the youth moaned and rushed into the hostel. blithe. the elder and the younger knight, they sallied forth at three; how far they went on level ground it matters not to me; what time they reached the foot of hill, when they began to mount, are problems which i hold to be of very small account. the moment that each waved his hat upon the topmost peak to trivial query such as this no answer will i seek. yet can i tell the distance well they must have travelled o'er: on hill and plain, 'twixt three and nine, the miles were twenty-four. four miles an hour their steady pace along the level track, three when they climbed but six when they came swiftly striding back adown the hill; and little skill it needs, methinks, to show, up hill and down together told, four miles an hour they go. for whether long or short the time upon the hill they spent, two thirds were passed in going up, one third in the descent. two thirds at three, one third at six, if rightly reckoned o'er, will make one whole at four the tale is tangled now no more. ten answers have been received. of these, one is wrong, galanthus nivalis major, who insists on inviting two guests, one being the governor's wife's brother's father . if she had taken his sister's husband's father instead, she would have found it possible to reduce the guests to one . of the nine who send right answers, sea-breeze is the very faintest breath that ever bore the name she simply states that the governor's uncle might fulfill all the conditions by intermarriages wind of the western sea, you have had a very narrow escape be thankful to appear in the class-list at all bog-oak and bradshaw of the future use genealogies which requirepeople instead of by inviting the governor's father's sister's husband instead of his father's wife's brother . i cannot think this so good a solution as one that requires only caius and valentine deserve special mention as the only two who have supplied genealogies. \""
